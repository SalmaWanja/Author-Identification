Abigail Arunga,"Dear World Bank,
(Of course the title line should read Dear Chinese government, dear IMF, dear Bill Gates Foundation, dear...anyone else who feels like it makes any sense to give Kenya money, but for brevity’s sake, because that’s a pretty long list, I’ll just use World Bank this to a representative entity).
I just read in the paper today that you’re giving Kenya $1 billion (Sh107 billion) to help maintain fiscal stability and also help in the fight against Covid-19. If I’m being honest, WB, I really wish you hadn’t done that. See, here’s the thing. Kenya doesn’t need any more money. Why? We haven’t even used what we’ve got. We’ve been getting all kinds of help, left, right and centre – and that’s great. Truly! It’s always nice to feel cared for and considered. Wow, someone’s thinking of us! Someone’s trying to help us through this very hard time! Brilliant! But Kenyans have not really seen the effect of the money that is being literally poured into Kenya at the moment. Why? Your guess is as good as mine. But it does look like the money is sent to the bank account, and then disappears shortly after. Which means, really, you’re not giving money to Kenya – you’re giving money to a few very specific Kenyans.
Which Kenyans? Good question.
It isn’t the ones having to pay for quarantine, that’s for sure. It isn’t the medics who need protective gear to do their jobs. And it isn’t those evicted from Kariobangi because they have so many other places to go in the midst of a pandemic. Wait, if the money donated isn’t being used for these people, then what is it being used for? Maybe it is the one the Daily Nation reported about? It reported that “Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe and his Treasury counterpart Ukur Yattani have been summoned to appear before the Senate and National Assembly Health committees over alleged misappropriation of Sh1.3 billion Covid-19 funds.” This comes as President Uhuru Kenyatta dismissed claims of misappropriation of the funds after the Health ministry shared an itemised budget of how the money was spent. So there’s a mystery at the ministry. And then there’s the ones who were running the donation fund, founded after the fiasco at Kibra that ensued from a free for all food distribution. No heads are rolling.
Either, the WB and affiliates, you’re so intent on being good humanitarian organisations that you don’t notice the theft (unlikely), or you don’t care that there is theft.
The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation does a lot of reporting work to check whether the projects they are working on are moving forward. Do other people do the same? Do they ensure that they’re not just buying someone’s private jet? It isn’t that hard to track, is it?
And once you see headlines like these, why do you continue to give five Kenyans money? Or are you just as bad as the five, trying to buy a country that shouldn’t be for sale?
Please stop.
Sincerely,
One of the Kenyans who are not getting the money but are still being taxed and yelled at from podiums about the total number of Covid-19 cases"
Abigail Arunga,"Here’s what I want to see after Corona is out, and no, this isn’t an April Fool’s joke.
I want everyone who was working, and working overtime, at their essential jobs to be given a raise. All of them. And staggered holidays. Because they deserve it and even now, there is no way we are going to get through this without them.
These include but are not limited to: bankers, doctors, nurses, supermarket cashiers, stockers, food delivery drivers, chemical engineers, manufacturing employees, and pharmacists.
The list goes on – mostly because as a typical Kenyan, I don’t even know the whole host of people who it takes to keep Kenyans fed, and keep other Kenyans fighting this thing.
I hope when medics are going on strike, we remember that they already asked for all the resources that they are lacking now. I hope we begin to understand that every day, for them, is a brush with something that may or may not kill them, and they’ve been the soldiers in this battle for years already.
In the same vein, I never again want to see anyone telling me, a freelance writer, that all I am doing is worth peanuts.
I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but now everyone seems to be getting through whiling away the days (if indeed they are whiling away the days) largely through social media, and/or the products of creatives all over the world.
Creatives are the ones making videos for education, giving out free concerts, doing live free DJ sets, telling people how to make basic masks and then adding an Ankara touch to it if only to make sure you don’t touch your face, thinking of a hundred different quizzes for people to do on WhatsApp concerning fruits and grammar and who knows what else.
Entertainment is not just entertainment. It is an industry that deserves respect, and has done so for a long time. It is not just ‘writing something small’ or ‘just drawing a ka-picture.’ It is fundamental to the human race. Finally, I am ready for a capitalist and socialist revolution.
Capitalist in that we finally realise that money is not the be all and end all of everything, and that preserving human life surely has to be more important than employers in non-essential work forcing their employees to continue going to work, scared and unable to fight the man – and that there are bigger and more important things than how much money you can make in a month, when the ability to make money is taken away. Socialist in that we finally realise that community should be valued above all, because when everything leaves, that is all that is left; socialist in that we look to our fellow humans and realise that not everyone has water to wash their hands 12 times a day, and that is not right and will never be; socialist in that we actually have motivation to fix our crumbling systems before they ruin us altogether; and socialist enough for when the time comes to go to a ballot, we choose based on a hunger we remember from now, when leaders could not buy masks but could buy campaign shirts, in the absence of welfare systems or a system that cares about us. I hope we remember to choose us after coronavirus."
Abigail Arunga,"Kavengi Kitonga is a visual artist, researcher, and a make-up artist. You can find her work on Instagram @miss_kitonga and at Edgy Bold on Facebook.
1. You're an economist, a researcher and a make-up artist. How did you discover all these passions?
My entry into economics was accidental. Initially, I had been selected for a different course in which I had no interest. I sought an inter-faculty transfer and ended up in the economics department. There are many who tell me that I would make a good lawyer, but research is almost like preparing a defense, only that the audience is a journal paper. I am naturally intrigued by arguments and logic, which is why research appeals to me.
Since I was young, I have always had an artistic side, but I wasn’t able to explore it until much later. I got into make-up after campus when I was idle and jobless and desperately looking for something to do. The more I learnt more about make-up, the more I loved it. Oh, and I can sing too!
2. Of your many gigs, which one makes you feel most creative?
I really liked the work I did with the Tinga Tinga musical. It was a beautiful experience. I was allowed a lot of freedom to develop fresh ideas!
3. How useful is your academic background in your creative career?
What I’ve come to learn is that creativity requires structure and discipline. I have a very strict two-hour routine that I follow every day – one hour of makeup practice and one hour of theory. After that, I allow myself time to meditate. I follow this routine religiously because I want to understand everything about make-up. Ultimately, I plan to transition from make-up application to visual artistry.
4. Why the name Edgy Bold? And what are your thoughts on the Kenyan make-up application industry?
That name captures the kind of work I aim to put out. This year, I plan to fearlessly articulate my “wild” ideas. The Kenyan industry is developing quite well, but I think that there is still plenty of room to integrate various forms of make-up beyond beauty and body art. By the end of 2020, through my timeline, you shall know what I mean.
5. What do you think about the curfew and the violence that we’ve witnessed since it was introduced? Should artists be commenting on such stuff?
I think everyone has a right to speak on anything they want. Our opinions may differ, but the right to speak remains ours."
Abigail Arunga,"I’ve just finished watching the last episode of the latest season of Insecure. If you’re reading this, I am already assuming that you know who Lawrence is in the first place, which is why you wanted to read this piece.
If not, let me educate you: Insecure is the child of Senegalese American film genius Joissa Rae Diop, better known to you as Issa Rae, and it is the gritty and beautiful depiction of a black girl and her friends, living in Los Angeles, being complicated and almost 30. It’s truthful, it’s hearty, it’s funny, it’s smart, it’s real and awkward – a throwback to one of her first shows, The Misadventures of Awkward Black Girl, on YouTube.
Here is where the spoilers begin.
Issa, in this last episode, is meeting up with her fine ex boyfriend Lawrence to have a conversation, even though she isn’t sure about what. When they meet up, because they were together for five years, the inside jokes are easy, the innuendo is tangible, and the audience continues to ask what we’ve been asking for the last three seasons: are they really going to get back together?
BOTH ARE SINGLE
The answer, by the end, is still unclear. Both of them are single, thanks to the hearts they’ve shrivelled along the way. Both of them are more willing to talk about their past relationship in a more mature manner than when they left it. And both are different people from who they were all those years ago.
This is precisely why Issa shouldn’t revisit this! Listen, we all have that ex who we wonder ‘what if’ for. But there is a reason they are your ex, and a good dicking down won’t change that…no matter how much they still look handsome in candlelight, or how lonely you are. When Lawrence and Issa were hanging out at the art fair, the sparks were so hot they were catching me in my sitting room. But the spark of sudden romance is an obvious reaction to seeing and being around someone you thought you were going to marry. Of course you are going to feel things.
Which is why you should do the right thing and call all your friends to remind you why you left in the first place. Issa and Lawrence are not the same Issa and Lawrence from, even, a season ago. I don’t even know if they completely know themselves at this point. Yes, they both made mistakes. But now, they fit together easily because of familiarity, not because it’s right. They’re both coming off the highs of failed relationships – and Lawrence isn’t even completely done with his last one!
Issa should not take Lawrence back. And neither should you. If anything, TSA Bae was the one who really had her back – understood consent, brought her free stolen stuff form the airport with each visit and was open and honest about his preferences both inside and outside the bed. What’s not to like?
But more importantly – is Daniel ever coming back?"
Abigail Arunga,"Here are a few things you can do with your time in May, going into June, as the majority of the population has a lot of time on their hands, but not much else:
1. Make sure you remind Babu Owino that teaching a chemistry class online doesn’t erase from our minds some of his past dramas, including the court case in which he’s accused of casually shooting a dude in the club, casually, and puffing on shisha right after.
2. Don’t worry about whether or not you’re being productive in the times of Covid-19. Not everyone can be. Do what you can each day. It isn’t everyone who can learn a new skill or a new language or start an online side hustle or be on multiple Zoom meetings in a week. Some of us in this camp are trying to fight off the exhaustion from panic and fear of the unknown. Breathe. Meditate. Pray. This too shall pass.
3. Commit time to trying to find out where Ezekiel Mutua got his PhD from (spoiler alert: nowhere). There’s a handy Twitter handle for this with varied suggestions that might be helpful in your search, implying locations such as your phone gallery for your downloads, the boot of the car in your estate that has stalled there since the 80s, and the monkey on Kenya Power’s payroll - basically, not Moi University.
4. Check on your family. Your parents. Your neighbours. Your older relatives. The people around you who need help. The people who you know for sure need help, who are suffering during a time when the economy has significantly slowed down and the government can’t be relied upon. Once again, Kenyans are largely on their own, and it will be up to other Kenyans to help them – for a while.
5. Message your respective but not respectable government official about what they are planning to do about Covid-19 in their jurisdiction. Are they giving out masks? Food? Advice? Campaign t-shirts? They’re probably on Facebook, if not taking very important PR savvy pictures to look like they care about their constituents. Ask them every day and see if they respond (my MP, Jaguar, didn’t respond. My MCA responded to say nothing is being given out).

6. In the spirit of number four, watch all the things that all these artists are putting out - from DJs to authors, and tip them using that little number indicated at the bottom of the page. Everyone is trying to live, and haba na haba hujaza kibaba (little by little fills the measure). I would say art is an essential service at this point, because without it, the masses would be losing their minds further than we already are, don’t you think? Entertainment is a vital distraction – something we all need every so often – in these times, and something that contributes to a certain quality of life. Don’t feel bad for indulging, and thank its producers.

Wash your hands. Wear a mask. Don’t go to Tanzania, but if you have to sneak out through a panya route (illegal crossing), just don’t sneak back. Stay there"
Bitange Ndemo,"Whether you believe in prophesy or not, it is not easy to argue with the view that someone has touched the global reset button.
More often than not, a reset button is necessary when things have gone wrong and you want to re-start afresh.
Prior to the start of 2020, a significant number of people had started to warn of impending disaster due to manmade megatrends such as increased carbon emission that is pushing global warming to unsustainable levels and a burgeoning population that is putting a strain on the planet’s resources.
Besides, the Covid-19 virus, the year 2020 has come with so many reasons why we must question ourselves over the sustainability of human actions known to be inimical to the environment as we have always known it.
RAGING FIRES
Globally, the environment is changing. From raging fires witnessed in Australia and California to floods in Europe, Asia and Africa, not to forget the locust invasion in the horn of Africa, and drought in the tropics, we are paying dearly for our actions as each of these disasters threaten our livelihood.
These rapid changes require a megatrend analysis to understand the interventions we need now and in the days to come in order to ensure sustainable development in a voraciously competitive world.
We also need to understand new disruptive platforms that threaten the entirety of the existing business models.
With Covid-19, the reset button has been activated. Rather than spend time agonising on the present and how we restart from where we stopped, we should spend more time trying to figure out how we can emerge from the constant bombardment of calamities.
WASTE OF TIME
The eagerness to start from where we paused and continue with business as usual irrespective of the uncertainties that lie ahead is simply a waste of time.
It would mean we learnt nothing from this experience, and that we let the opportunities presented by this crisis slip through our fingers.
There is clearly a need to make new commitments at individual, organisational and national levels as a measure to mitigate against either environmental degradation or unplanned population growth.
To start with the environment, the reset button has revealed what we would never have known. That lockdowns all over the world have made the world cleaner than ever before. The impact of lockdowns on the environment in various cities has been captured with startling images of now cleaner cities.
This is not to celebrate lockdowns since they undermine economic growth. However, we must ask some tough questions: How do we maintain a cleaner environment and still create jobs without polluting the environment?
This is an important question especially now when studies are that showing inhaling dirty air makes Covid-19 more lethal. The Harvard University’s School of Public Health analysed data of tiny pollutants particles known as PM2.5 and established that these particles when inhaled over a long period of time sharply raise the chances of dying from the virus.
People who lived in areas with one microgram per cubic meter more PM2.5 in the air had a Covid-19 death rate that was 15 per cent higher. The study validates a 2003 study in Asia during the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) which established that death rates in more polluted areas of China were twice as high as in the least polluted areas.
OPPORTUNISTIC DISEASES
There is no doubt that pollution causes diseases. The decline in patients visiting hospital could be as a result of a decline in opportunistic diseases that come as a result of environmental pollution be it in water or air.
There is need for research to establish if there could be any relationship in the decline of patients and the increasing cleaner air especially in cities.
At an individual level, we must commit to walk, run or bike and use less of gasoline powered vehicles. At the organisational level, it will be cheaper to provide employees with pooled transport and discourage personal vehicles to reduce number of vehicles on the roads. At the national level, we need new policies to emphasise investment in green energy.
Population explosion, another megatrend, is about to explode, especially in Africa. We cannot continue to pride ourselves on how we possibly have a population dividend.
There could perhaps be no dividend at all if we continue to give birth without regard to resources. Our youth will become a formidable resource if we are capable of supporting them to their fullest potential.
Our population is not expanding because we want it to, but because we have persistently disenfranchised women. Although the gap between male and female in secondary school enrolment is narrowing (51.6 per cent male against 48.4 per cent female), UNICEF says that the greatest gender disparity exists among the poorest quintile group of Kenya, with attendance rates being 33.1 per cent and 25 per cent for males and females respectively. This is a recipe for manufacturing poverty.
Many young women give birth without regard to resources that can support the children and as a result exacerbate poverty.
CHANGE TACT
The response to poverty in most African countries is often wrong. We never use data and, as a result, Africa contributes more than 50 per cent of the global poorest. We need to change tact.
Unfortunately, disillusioned young fathers act irresponsibly. The burden is left with young mothers, hence poverty. With more children, we aggravate any chances of ever dealing with poverty effectively.
The only way out is to reset how we deal with this glaring youth crisis. For a start, the government must spend more resources in providing skills to these young people and start deliberately empowerment programmes otherwise we all perish in the hands of disgruntled youth.
In technology, the reset button is very important. It is often activated as a last resort after every other attempt has been made to troubleshoot the issues with a machine. Often when you are left with no choice but to reset and start afresh.
It is analogous to life. The world has been pushed to the limits. That explains why we cannot contain the fires nor stop the floods and why we are now facing a new, mysterious, but very dangerous, virus.
The decision to reset the world back to factory standards was made for us by the novel coronavirus. We now have the opportunity to think a fresh and build a sustainable future"
Bitange Ndemo,"The primary force for discovering new ideas, products and services is a problem or need. It is perhaps what motivated early Greek philosophers to come up with the idiom “Necessity is the mother of invention.” The Covid-19 pandemic has forced every human being to think of solutions to the problems the virus brings. Several universities in Kenya rushed to produce a ventilator in response to a desperate need that the demand for ventilators could outstrip supply. Like gallant soldiers, they sought to defend their country from the embarrassment of not making even a simple ventilator. Others sought to develop an app for contact tracing. There are at least more than 100 new applications around healthcare.
At the street level, citizens have armed themselves with all manner of traditional healing products and solutions. There are those who believe that the Neem tree could be the magic medicine for warding off the virus. Others ramped up their experience in building gaming solutions or ventured into e-learning to build a local platform. A section of society is now arguing that the so-called innovators in Kenya are copycats. These in my view are voices of doom. Rarely do people come up with new ideas. American author Mark Twain once wrote, “There is no such thing as a new idea. It is impossible. We simply take a lot of old ideas and put them into a sort of mental kaleidoscope. We give them a turn and they make new and curious combinations. We keep on turning and making new combinations indefinitely; but they are the same old pieces of coloured glass that have been in use through all the ages.” Gumzo, a Nairobi-based video conferencing startup, has emerged to challenge global platforms such as Google Hangout and Zoom. Covid-19 forced the founders to shift some of their attention from Usiku Games, a gaming company they had created to tackle the problem of youth gambling across Africa, to setting up a simpler conferencing platform that can address local problems. They simply leveraged their in-game video conferencing platform to build a solution that could be used more widely to tackle the pandemic. Unlike other platforms, Gumzo has no app to download, or extensions to configure. Their calls happen in the browser. This means that the calls will automatically work on any smartphone or PC, right away. Once someone has a trusted account, they can join a meeting with a single click. The simplification makes it possible for students in far-flung rural areas to participate in learning away from school. The solution is likely to bring greater inclusivity given the fact that studies have shown that when mobile became affordable to all citizens, it precipitated productivity improvement and in some cases created jobs.This quick intervention will not just help students’ online learning, but will also revolutionise the micro, small and medium enterprises by providing a solution that validates what they are purchasing away from their place of work. The founders of Gumzo realise the critical importance of their solution given the fact that Covid-19 has made it difficult for children to attend school. As a mitigation measure, teachers need a simple solution to perform their duties. That is perhaps the reason why they have allowed all public school teachers to use the platform for free to virtually teach their students for the remainder of the year. Teachers could also use the same for family calls if need be. This gesture is partly to enable teachers to familiarise themselves with the technology as well as to challenge other organisations to donate cheap smart phones for students to access learning.This donation of a simplified platform indeed validates my earlier point in this column that if we had the will, we can indeed enable every child to learn online. Since we have no idea how long the virus shall be with us, there is a compelling case to develop new mitigation measures. The fall back may as well be continued online learning. A crisis indeed precipitates innovation. We now have the opportunity to look into many other problems and come up with innovative ideas. Many of the Newly Industrialized Economies of Asia grew on the backdrop of creatively utilising incremental innovation to a point where they have improved their capability to compete. We need to emulate their development model if we ever hope to catch up."
Bitange Ndemo,"In one of my recent articles, I wrote that “good quality work is rare but demand for it is abundant. In the social media, some youths asked me to expound my statement. Days later, we convened an online discussion not just focused on the statement but on the entire article which was about the future of work. In total, 23 people participated in the discussion. So how do we get to provide a good quality job? Eddy (not his real name), started with the question. “What I meant in that statement is that if you are given any job, first demand to know the employer’s expectations and try to meet them. This applies to any job,” I responded, adding that the process can be embarrassing and sometimes painful. Introspectively, I quickly said that sometimes the employer might not even know exactly what you need to do for him or her to feel that the job has been done well. However, employers do appreciate a good outcome. In which case you ask the experts or try and read what doing a great job in your respective field is. I remember when I was appointed PS, the first thing I did was to ask the stakeholders what they expected. They listed many complaints including sector policy, connectivity and privatisation of the telecommunication sector. Others dismissed me as a daydreamer but in the end, we got a lot going. There was a bit of silence, which I took to mean that the participants needed some example to carry the message home. “Supposing I was hired today as a mower, should I look for a lawnmower and start working or should I seek to know what is expected of me and which tools I need to do the good job?” I asked. “Pretty simple,” Dan (not his real name) said, “get the lawnmower and get to work.” Dan’s response was archetypal cultural response where people always fear to ask what is right or expected. Yet if you check people’s lawns, there are multiple outcomes. I then decided to give my rant on these mismatches. A good mower would ask for training. I say this from experience. In high school we used to have cooks not chefs since they were not required to have any training or experience. A simple meal like githeri had different outcomes depending on who cooked. None of the customers (students) liked the food. The link between the teachers and customers (students and parents) failed too because the outcome was not defined. The consequence of our failure to train cooks and update teachers’ professional skills continuously led to the division between the haves and have-nots in education.
NO JOBS
We have fundis (artisans) who are not really fundis but we continue to tolerate their work. When we need “good work” to be done, we import these artisans at a time when youths in the country have no jobs. In South Africa for example, due to severe shortage of artisanal skills, the country had to import artisans from the Middle East and India to help put up facilities for the World Cup. Several other African countries are doing the same for major projects to deliver “good work.” Artisanal work has been elusive for people who need to work either because of lack of training or failure to understand what good work is. Future jobs will be plenty but the distinctive differentiator will be the ability to do “good work” that meets the customer’s expectations. Studies show that the causes of high youth unemployment in sub-Saharan Africa include inadequate skills, lack of experience, and a mismatch between education and training and requisite job skills. The mismatch between skills and qualification is more pronounced in Kenya where a number of youths trained through apprenticeship system lack recognisable certification. The National Employment Authority (NEA) was supposed to rectify this problem through a process of equating skills and recognizing informal qualification through certification but the mission appears to have been lost somewhere along the way. As the Fourth Industrial Revolution becomes a reality, lack of adaptability will exacerbate unemployment among the youth. That course, however, can be altered if African governments do two things. First, there is need to invest in modern Technical and Vocational Education and Training institutions that meet the requirements of the future of work. This means that TVETS should offer courses in all emerging technologies in addition to artisanal training. The institutions must be well equipped and must collaborate with other international TVETS in order to keep pace with technology.
COMPETE GLOBALLY
For a carpenter to produce “good quality job”, they need a 3D printer to develop a prototype for the customer to pre-approve what they need. Then they will need a computer numerical control (CNC) machines to do the cutting to specification. With these, a local carpenter will have a chance to compete globally and create more jobs as well as produce for exports. Second, the governments must work towards removing the perception that TVETS are for those who failed in school and that they are a last resort solution. Perhaps it is time we changed the name TVET to universities of applied sciences just as Germany and other countries refer to them. Without the change, there will be no future of work. We’ll just be doomed to fail. I concluded my rant by saying that governments are often slow. That leaves us – the followers – to do what is necessary to deal with the chronic mismatches that characterise our continent and seek to do a good job to remain relevant in the work space while at the same time contribute to our prosperity. With every passing day, technology makes us irrelevant one way or another but we tend to keep up with where our interests lie. It is time we dealt with what makes us irrelevant in the global job environment and not just our interests. If we can do “good work”, the demand for our services will follow us to wherever we are. After some silence, Dan asked, “Where do people learn all this?” “Good question,” I responded. “Remember I said at the beginning that you must always be inquisitive and not to always take instructions that are not clarified. Reading widely helps too but more important sharing like we have done today summarises many books into the single hour we’ve met. Thank you."
Bitange Ndemo,"Last week, the Treasury released new guidelines barring mobile application lenders from using credit reference bureaus (CRBs) to share information on defaulters and basically disabled fintech innovations in the country. Although they gave no reason for this policy change, their action will slow down innovation. They see these lenders as immorally benefitting from poor citizens. However, analysts see the hand of the banking sector that has had sleepless nights from emerging fintech innovations. In general, legacy banking institutions see fintechs as a threat to their enterprise. Let us not forget that prior to the entry of fintechs, the banking sector in Kenya treated their customers and potential customers with a lot of contempt. To open a bank account, you needed references. Loans required huge collateral and guarantees. Even in cases of credit guarantee schemes for MSMEs, the sector has had no energy to stimulate growth. Some of the banks pay more attention to noninterest income, charging for practically everything, including monthly service charges, deposit and transaction fees, penalty fees, insufficient funds fees, statements, annual fees, inactivity fees, transaction fees, over-the-limit fees, cheque and deposit slip fees, late payment fees and so on. In the past, some banks operated like the mafia, colluding with valuers to auction client assets at throwaway prices for defaulting on loan repayment. Lending rates were artificially inflated so that some loan portfolios could double in value within a short period of time. It is hard to imagine that a sector with this track record would have the audacity to point fingers at fintechs as charging exorbitant rates of interest. Fintech innovations have played a major role moderating the banking sector in Kenya. Their use of artificial intelligence to create credit scoring for offering non collateralized loans is novel. As a result, research now shows that they have brought about greater financial inclusivity. There is enormous amount of data that the government should have used to understand who in spite the high interest rates benefits from the emerging model of lending. A 2017 study by the Financial Sector Deepening Kenya, a financial inclusion organisation, established that the majority of Kenyans access digital credit for business purposes such as investing and paying salaries, and to meet everyday household needs. The borrowers are largely microenterprise organisations that had been fleeced by shylocks for many years until they found refugee in fintechs. Most borrow in the wee hours of the morning to buy supplies and refund in the evening to avoid paying too much in interest. Of course, there are those who default, hence the reason why the non-performing loans (NPLs) for fintechs are high. In such a situation, the Treasury and the Central Bank of Kenya should have made intervention that would promote innovation while seeking to lower the lending rates by mobile lenders. The solution still remains weeding out the bad apples and helping build a bigger pool of creditworthy borrowers. The policy pronouncement will have no impact on any of the defaulters. They perhaps don’t know the fact that being delisted from CRBs doesn’t absolve them from paying for their financial mischievousness. Digital footprints rarely go away easily. They could come up in future to haunt them. The best thing for them is to pay up. In theory, fintech innovation in Kenya has put the country on a path to greater competitiveness, improved productivity and better services. These are all ingredients that with time will lower lending rates and facilitate inclusivity. We could have dealt with poverty more easily than any other country, but we have now put the brakes on innovation under the guise of creating access to credit during the raging pandemic. Banks don’t lend Sh1,000. They have far too much baggage in cost to lend that much but that is the amount most people need to borrow to make a living. If those who borrowed to bet defaulted, must we punish microenterprises for sins committed by irresponsible gamblers? The truth is that those who defaulted will have no way of getting into banking halls for access to credit. In the absence of a financial inclusion strategy in Kenya, innovation would have dealt with the financial oligopolies (a market structure controlled by a few institutions). The entire financial services sector needs diversity. Parliament should not pass the law that is meant to kill fintechs. Their decisions must be data driven."
Bitange Ndemo,"The World Economic Forum (WEF) on May 11 suggested that there are three ways the Covid-19 pandemic could actually spark a better future for Africa. The three sparks that could light a flame include: strengthening the health sectors, rethinking social protection for the vulnerable and industrialisation. Since most countries attained independence, leaders from virtually every African country have travelled abroad for medical services, leaving their people at the mercy of dilapidated health systems. Covid-19 brought forth the fact that during a pandemic African countries are on their own, and that the people and their leaders are in the same boat. That fact will undoubtedly force a rethink to prioritize investment in health systems. With a large informal sector, issues like social protection for the vulnerable has never featured in policy frameworks but the pandemic has forced it into a top policy consideration. Indeed, WEF acknowledges Kenya and Equatorial Guinea as two African states that are offering excellent examples of countries that have regulated and put in place social protection systems that will survive and outlast our battle against this common enemy. The crisis forced quick innovations, with some universities coming up with contraptions of ventilators. The WEF article noted that the continent’s poor pharmaceutical capacity has been a source of amazement to locals and foreigners alike. Bangladesh, a poorer country than many African countries, produces 97 percent of the national demand for medicines in contrast to Africa, which is almost 100 percent dependent on imports. Several other articles on post pandemic Africa that came out in May such as the McKinsey’s report, ‘‘Reopening and reimagining Africa: How the Covid-19 crisis can catalyse change’’, highlight similar opportunities presented by the crisis. The continent, therefore, must ride on the wave of creativity and innovation to build a sustainable manufacturing sector. The people have proven the fact that they do not have to import some of the Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) required mostly in the healthcare sector. Already, Kenya Bureau of Standards (Kebs) through the National Standards Council has in the recent past developed some specifications on critical care ventilators, reusable cloth masks and a standard on protective clothing for the purpose of building local capacity to mitigate against the pandemic. The crisis has shown the critical importance of self-reliance that many of the simple imports that Africa imports from other countries should cease. If the continent builds better supply chains, better value addition and reduced waste especially in food, Africa could easily be self-sufficient in food. The current food import bill of $35 billion according to Africa Development Bank could be converted into capital to develop a resilient manufacturing sector. Unlike in the past, WEF has rightfully noted that African States are developing strategic and in-depth approaches to human development, regional integration, digitisation, industrialisation, economic diversification, fiscal and monetary policies, and international solidarity. In short, they are rethinking the causes of the continent's underdevelopment and coming up with feasible solutions. Africa’s underdevelopment is partly caused by failure to integrate trade within the continent. Vera Songwe, Executive Secretary of the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA), noted in a recent article that the share of intra-African exports as a percentage of total African exports has increased from about 10 percent in 1995 to around 17 percent in 2017, but it remains low compared to levels in Europe (69 percent), Asia (59 percent), and North America (31 percent). Africa’s internal market, not exports to other places, will matter more for the continent’s growth. It means that the growing digitalization will grow Africa-specific solutions such as mobile money just as China’s startups in the digital space have grown within a very short period of time. The news about the delay of the start date from July 1, 2020 to next year does not reflect desire to see Covid-19 as a spark for a renewed Africa. The pandemic has opened African eyes that in a crisis most countries retreat to their core constituency. The continent must arise and invest in health systems, respond to emerging crises with innovation and seek to become self-reliant. Basic necessities like medicine, food and other essentials should be manufactured locally. The launch of the African Continental Free Trade Area must be fast-tracked irrespective of the state that we are in, specifically the coronavirus pandemic, to ensure continental self-sufficiency"
Faith Oneya,"Never let anybody say Kenyans are not a caring lot. Our collective empathy played out on a global scale this past week when we donated the “Haki Yetu” phrase for use in the #BlackLivesMatter demonstrations in the United States, which were sparked by the death of a black man, George Floyd, who was cuffed and asphyxiated by policemen. Nobody can forget the infamous Alex Ndiritu from Nyeri who exported rage to America when, in replying to a post by CNN about the protests, urged Americans to “burn the White House”.
POLICE  BRUTALITY
Kenyans joined Mr Ndiritu and the world in speaking out against police brutality and racism. Raila ‘Agwambo’ Odinga also Tweeted a Martin Luther King-inspired message about the same, and the irony of global versus local empathy did not escape anybody. Beyond the apparent hypocrisies, the show of concern and solidarity was a beautiful example of what “If my brother’s in trouble so am I” looks like. One can only hope the support for #JusticeForGeorgeFloyd yields an everlasting change in race-inspired violence world over. Like any other “hotbed of terror”, Kenya is no stranger to unlawful killings by policemen. On June 1, a homeless man in Mathare, known as Vaite to his neighbours, was walking home when a policeman shot him dead. Moments earlier, policemen had shot in the air, ostensibly to disperse the residents and force them to adhere to the 7pm curfew. Nobody seems to know Vaite’s real name but most Kenyans on social media have seen the graphic images of his body by now. As painful as it is to say it, even his death was not as significant as Mr Floyd’s. The Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA) reported that in enforcing the curfew, the police have to date killed 15 people and injured 31. Perhaps it’s bullet-proof jackets Kenyans need and not masks. Vaite is just one of the 16 people shot dead every month by Kenyan police, according to the Deadly Force database run by the Nation Newsplex team. The project monitors local media, social media and human rights and IPOA reports to track the demographics of each person killed by the police and the circumstances surrounding their deaths.The number is most likely much higher, according to human rights groups, as 16 only accounts for the reported cases.
KILLINGS
Given that the unlawful killings are concentrated in the slums and low-income areas, one is tempted to conclude that while racism bites America, classism is what bites us at home. The question then is: why is there so much apathy about what’s happening locally and so much empathy for events occurring thousands and thousands of kilometres away? It shouldn’t be surprising, given how pervasive the American culture is in our lives: from the music, language, dressing to TV shows. If this does not give any insights, then the police spokesman’s responses about police brutality during an interview with NTV certainly do. Mr Charles Owino said police officers who were accused of brutality were “probably young and drunk from the little power they have”, adding that may have been provoked by errant civilians.
PROVOKED
Provoked? Maybe President Trump shared his script with him. Or vice versa. You can never tell these days.
If American novelist and activist Lydia Maria Child was alive today, she would tell Mr Owino that the US is a warning rather than an example to the world. Kenyans were rightly outraged by Mr Owino’s sentiments. But the insights lie in what Mr Owino left unsaid: That the culture of violence from policemen in Kenya is so entrenched and normalised that not even a photo of a bloody body is enough to summon rage that could meet the proportions Mr Floyd’s death inspired. Certainly not enough rage to make the #JusticeforVaite hashtag trend for long, if that’s a valid measure. The tragedy is that everything will soon be restored to factory settings as we separate ourselves from empathy and work ourselves back to the familiar story of policemen killing and maiming innocent people. What a pity."
Faith Oneya,"The Covid-19 pandemic has been a disorienting experience for everybody but has likely hit our children the hardest, especially those who were waiting to be sacrificed at the altar of the all-consuming Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) and the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) examinations. The pandemic has steadily been unpicking the seams of their tightly woven plans to pass.In many ways, these national exams are the most rudimentary of measures of learners’ intellectual capabilities. But they’re hallowed in the hierarchy of academic achievements and remain profitable for many cartels. They should be regarded as one of the safety concerns for learners. A majority of them will suffer their way through them. Some might lose their self-esteem, minds and lives in the process. There have been mixed reactions from the public about schools reopening, with some sections calling for candidates to be allowed back first and others calling for the postponement of the exams. Kenya National Union of Teachers (Knut) boss Wilson Sossion said nobody in this country should gamble with the lives of learners and teachers, adding that KCPE and KCSE are not a ticket to heaven. Amen to that.
SANITATION
It’s been said over and over again that the war against Covid-19 will be won with proper sanitation. But reports have shown that this is a pipe dream for most schools, which not only lack running water but also don’t have enough toilets for learners. A World Health Organisation (WHO) report from 2017 revealed that schools pose a great sanitation risk and flagged Kenya as one of the countries lagging behind in this area. More than that, the yawning gaps in safety of learners in schools are most likely far more threatening than Covid-19 could ever be. Termed second homes for our children, experience has proved that they are anything but that because of the danger lurking in the shadows. A 2019 report by the Kenya Union of Post Primary Education Teachers on school safety revealed most schools in Kenya can’t guarantee the safety of learners. This brings to mind the kindergarten pupil in Mombasa who was killed after falling through a bus floor in 2017.
SCHOOL DISASTERS
The report also says most schools did not break down safety regulations to enable children to understand and avoid risk. But it’s more than just a knowledge gap question. The tragic events at Precious Talent school on that bleak Monday, September 23, 2019, illustrate how some schools have become the place where children go to die better than any statistics could. A recap, for those who may have forgotten, is that their one-storey classroom collapsed, seven lives were lost, and over 60 learners escaped with injuries. A year later, we have simply moved on as we shout about Covid-19 while awaiting the next tragedy because, let’s face it, nothing much has changed since then. There have been numerous media reports of learners using dilapidated structures not even suitable for goats as classrooms, especially in rural areas.
PERMANENT SOLUTIONS
Moreover, school fires have become the norm whenever national exams threaten the sanity of learners. From the Bombolulu Girls School incident in 1998, where 26 girls died, to the Kyanguli Secondary School fire in 2001 that saw 58 students burnt to death, it’s frightening to think that we’ve not seen the worst of it yet The Ministry of Education has time and again issued directives on how to tame these school fires, and recommended a raft of other measures to keep children safe in schools in general, but these words remain on the lips of officials and in dusty documents. A spot check of public schools on any given day will reveal the glaring dangers children are still exposed to. May the ghosts of the learners who lost their lives in schools haunt us until we find permanent solutions to ensure that schools never claim another soul"
Faith Oneya,"Faced with the daunting reality of empty accounts post-Covid-19, private schools have been forced to take control of their financial fate by reinventing their income streams at the expense of parents and learners. With all the attention focused on the war against Covid-19, most schools have taken the opportunity to make outrageous demands in terms of school fees, safe in the knowledge that their actions might barely be noticed. To be fair, the pandemic has forced some hard choices on schools, which were first to be closed on March 15 as they are considered high-risk areas because of the many learners they hold, and who come from different backgrounds. The Daily Nation recently carried a story showing how fancy schools are struggling to stay afloat. Nevertheless, this doesn’t negate the fact that some of the decisions taken by schools — like rushing to charge them astronomical amounts for virtual learning — have harmed parents. When Brookhouse School demanded a 90 per cent school fees payment from parents for online learning, they fought back by suing the school and the court compelled the institution to reduce the fees by half. Kudos to the parents. While one can’t extrapolate too much on the case of the Brookhouse School parents, given that they are not a towering example of the average Kenyan parent, it’s still a valid example of the frustrations most parents are feeling with their children’s schools.
SCARCE RESOURCES
The proponents of the Competency-Based Curriculum, to which a majority of schools in Kenya subscribe, boast about the level of involvement from a parent that’s needed for the learner to succeed but the top-down approach to imposing supplementary virtual learning classes on parents is the antithesis of this. Most parents will testify that nobody asked them what they needed and what would work for their children, schedules or homes.The notion of synchronous virtual learning, which most schools have suggested to or imposed on parents, is as utopian as it is unreasonable, given the limited computer access in homes as well as spotty WiFi, among other obstacles like the expenses involved and the crazy work schedules that parents who work in essential services have been forced to adapt to because of the pandemic. Kenya National Union of Teachers Secretary-General Wilson Sossion has pointed out that the practicability of virtual lessons is far from being a reality in Kenya, adding that supervision in a manner that’s useful to the students is also an issue. Despite much hype by the government and private schools about virtual learning, one of the things they fail to acknowledge is that it will leave out a significant proportion of learners. It will be survival for the wealthiest, not the fittest.Data from the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) revealed that the digital divide in Kenya is still a reality, as only one in five Kenyans have access to the internet.
BLANKET SOLUTIONS
The income of the parents also determines whether their children will access virtual lessons or not. The National ICT Survey Report (2018) by the Communication Authority and the KNBS indicated that employment and household size in many cases determine the household disposable income, which in turn determines whether individuals in households can afford radios, TVs, computers, internet and other ICT equipment. What’s clear is that by offering blanket solutions for virtual learning, private schools are just combing a dry riverbed. There is an opportunity here to respond to the abnormal times abnormally, to paraphrase Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe’s now-famous quote about Covid-19. In their quest to keep afloat, private schools should not forget to fully involve parents in designing solutions that will accommodate different learner’s and parents’ needs. Nobody will walk away from this pandemic unscathed, but as everything comes unglued after this, private schools can help lessen the impact by doing right by parents and learners"
Faith Oneya,"Wrath of God against wickedness’ is how a section of religious leaders from Kisumu described the Covid-19 pandemic while calling on the government to uphold the freedom of worship by appealing to President Uhuru Kenyatta to order the reopening of churches. In such times of uncertainty, everybody is latching onto explanations that make sense or give a sense of comfort. Many theories exist about the origins of the deadly virus and its reason for existence, some as ridiculous as they come. Such spurious sentiments have made their way into WhatsApp groups, where religion-based conspiracy theories about Covid-19 abound, including one about it being the “Mark of the Beast”.The trouble with such theories, especially when they are from figures of authority like religious leaders, is that they get in the way of behaviour change.
RESPONSIBILITY
The gravity of the situation gets lost in the blithe explanations about divine protection. To make it worse, they remove the responsibility of spreading the virus from human beings. Yet Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe’s throat must be dry by now from repeatedly reminding Kenyans that the responsibility of stopping the spread of Covid-19 starts with the individual.The said religious leaders, in a joint statement read by Episcopal Church of Africa Archbishop Joshua Koyoo, went ahead to quote President Kenyatta, who acknowledged the power of God that transcends science during the national prayer day. What they forgot to add is that the same president also provided practical solutions like curfews, more testing kits and other directives to forestall the spread of Covid-19; for he knew that it would take much, much more than prayers to save us all. The church has been criticised as being “the weakest link” in the fight against the pandemic and it’s easy to see why, especially since gathering together in worship is at the centre of most religions.
DISREGARD OF RULES
But religious leaders can play a critical role in showing their congregants that they can respect science but still worship God. Those calling for the reopening of churches need to stop and take stock of why their actions could have catastrophic results.They promised that they would observe at least 1.5 metres physical distancing and minimise worship hours to regulate attendance, but reopening churches should be the least of our priorities right now, especially given the wanton disobedience witnessed among some Kenyans who will use any excuse to gather and party. Any energies that could have been spent on reopening the churches should be redirected to inspiring behaviour change among worshippers. Most religious leaders have responded creatively, selflessly and innovatively to the new realities of the pandemic. From live-streaming services through social media and YouTube to live church services on TV and radio, they have ensured that they still nourish souls while sticking to the strict guidelines from the government.
ADVISE WORSHIPPERS
Pope Francis already set a great example and is quoted by international media outlets as having referred to medical officers as “the new prophets”. National Muslim Covid-19 Response Committee chair Muhammad Karama also recently announced that Muslims will stop performing the last ritual wash for Covid-19 cases. He quoted a verse from the Qur’an in lauding health workers on the frontline, saying their sacrifice is akin to saving the whole of mankind. Religion provides comfort amid all the uncertainty, physical, spiritual and mental challenges. But heeding to calls by science to maintain hygiene and social distance would serve humanity much better right now and the Church can be great allies of the government in driving this agenda. Religious leaders should explicitly spread the message to worshippers that the closure of places of worship during such times honours their faith."
Faith Oneya,"Kenyan autobiographies can be painfully predictable. Here’s a typical story plot: Boy grows up in abject poverty and has to walk for many kilometres every day just to get to the nearest primary school. Boy passes with flying colours and gets admitted to a prestigious national high school. Boy joins a public university in Kenya or a prestigious university abroad. Boy has a fulfilling career or starts a successful business. Boy then attributes his spotless, linear, successful life to hard work, God and a healthy dose of luck. The End. Sound familiar yet? These autobiographies (and biographies) are often devoid of accounts of any personal failures, fears or imperfections. They sometimes feel too linear, too sanitised, offering robot-like perfection which makes one question if they were indeed human beings that readers were supposed to relate to. Commenting about the biggest enemy confronting many Kenyan authors of biographies, Weekend writer Mutu wa Gethoi aptly described it as Okonkwo-like hubris so deftly described by Chinua Achebe in his book Things Fall Apart — unjustified self-aggrandisement by owners of the story. Thankfully, The Boy with Shoes does not suffer from this. The writer, Hillary Lisimba, first came to the public eye through the Engage Talks platform on YouTube when he gave a talk titled My Life, My Wife and Kilimani Mums where he humorously shared insights on his life as a dad parenting alone as his wife worked in a different country. Just like in his candid talk, the book is a no holds barred account of his life. Only that this time, he focuses on his childhood. He writes about growing up in Mbale in the 80s with a strict mother he nicknamed Thatcher and whose tongue was as quick as her hands in reprimanding him when he strayed from her rules. He describes her as a total replica of Britain’s Margaret Thatcher in word and deed. The author digs deep into his past and uses humour and witty descriptions to take the reader back with him to Mbale, Chotero village where “girls are more fertile than the farms”. He generously introduces us to the other colourful characters in his life like his uncle Tope, first crush Esther and his school teachers like the late Jumba Mamesa, to whom the book is dedicated in a luscious poem by the author at the beginning of the book. INDOMITABLE APPETITE Lisimba’s indomitable appetite for adventure is what the book seems to be anchored on but he also offers glimpses into the life-changing lessons he acquired alongside the beatings from his mother and teachers. It’s in chapter four that we get to experience his peculiar relationship with shoes that his mother Thatcher proudly buys for him. He pictures “fellow pupils admiring him, including those who hated him for no reason” but he finds out soon enough that shoes quickly make him an outsider. You need to read the book to find out exactly how this happens. For Lisimba, the shoes symbolise much more than privilege or prestige. The book’s charm, however, lies in the author’s ability to be vulnerable. For example, he admits that he missed a huge part of paternal upbringing because his father worked far away from home and that they are trying to form a bond to date. He’s unafraid to explore his emotional ups and downs throughout the text. It is the first in a series of five books where the author says he will explore what it means to be in a country that is ""always almost taking off but never does"" and if the first one is anything to go by, then the upcoming ones will be a treat.If nothing else, the book is celebration of a typical Kenyan childhood in the 80s and 90s."
