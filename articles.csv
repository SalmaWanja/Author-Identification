Faith Oneya,"If you have not felt the undue pressure to exponentially alter the course of your life in these Covid-19 times, then count yourself among the fortunate ones.
It has been said that Covid-19 has given us the gift of time. That this gift of time could deliver us from the yoke of procrastination by leading us to the path of unleashing our great potential and fulfilling ambitions we may have had before a virus forced us to keep social distance and stay at home.
The message here seems to be: stay at home but become great at something while at it.
Even a cursory glance at social media platforms reveals a flood of well-orchestrated and documented triumphs of people bettering themselves in dancing, parenting, knitting, gardening, interior design, cooking, and all manner of things.
Facebook Pages like “Let’s Cook Kenyan Meals” and “Home Beautiful” are swamped with such posts of great cooking, great gardening and great interior décor, among others.
Everyday conversations, too, are peppered with calls for people to come out of this period wiser, better-behaved, healthier, fitter, more knowledgeable, and perhaps closer to God or in better touch with their spirituality. There are forwards on WhatsApp specifically dedicated to preaching this gospel."
Faith Oneya,"If your achievement is sleeping for 11 hours, eating five meals a day, watching all the seasons of Selina and gaining four kilogrammes in a week, then you may have felt unworthy of this gift of time from Covid-19.
You shouldn’t, because with all your presumed shortcomings, you are enough. We all are. And there’s no greatness race to be won.
For many people, the decision to better themselves is couched in the belief that who they were before Covid-19 came calling was not good enough, and therefore, they need to use this period to manufacture a better version of themselves.
Such a view can only be described as anxiety-inducing because the more it infiltrates the mind the more mental pressure it exerts.
And while this may be up for debate, the only sure thing that such great expectations can cause to them and those around them is great frustration.
Life as we know it has already come to a shuddering halt. Some of the only guarantees we have are that lives and livelihoods will be lost. And that our physical and mental health will be compromised along the way."
Faith Oneya,"Just coming out of this stressful period alive and sane will be a great achievement, even if you are not wiser, fitter, healthier, kinder or more talented than you were before Covid-19.
The World Health Organisation has already warned that one of the main psychological effects of Covid-19 is elevated rates of stress or anxiety.
You must have already felt these emotions zig-zagging through your mind and body. Coupled with the fact that researchers have linked the increase in use of social media with a surge of mental afflictions such as depression and anxiety, one can easily conclude that most of us are sitting on a ticking time bomb as far as our mental health is concerned, especially if we follow the “make something out of yourself” crusade.
In fact, a 2015 research by Swansea University’s College of Human and Health Science found that too much time online could damage your immune system and make you more susceptible to flus and colds.
Perhaps it’s time to switch gears and start celebrating the mundane things in life: like sleeping, waking up, having a meal — anything that spells normalcy and plain old survival.
The couch potato who is whiling away his long days dressed in his pajamas and pondering over nothing in particular or filling his mind with watching mindless television and not making any effort to discover his super powers is probably doing himself a great favour.
Maybe our bulwark against mental stress and anxiety lies in cutting everybody around us some slack by lowering expectations of greatness and celebrating the mundane."
Faith Oneya,"South B’s Finest teems with lusty, quintessentially Kenyan phrases. Some call it ‘Kenglish’. Among other things, Kenglish demands that one starts a sentence with “Me I” and basically abandons the rather stringent English grammar rules that strip joy from everyday conversations.
Sample this sentence from the novel, for example: “Even me, I’m in the process of severing ties with some of those friends.” See? Kenglish through and through.
The novel does not suffer from the distractions of “proper” English and draws its strength and authenticity from this.
The author, Makena Maganjo, might have had the late rapper E-Sir in mind when she picked the title, for he is best known by his moniker “South C’s Finest”. Nevertheless, the debut novel by the trained economist who once dabbled in entrepreneurship is an original work of art.
The story is set in Malaba Estate, South B, where life in Kenya in the 1990s all through to the 2000s is seen through the eyes of three families who are as flawed as human beings can get. It is also through their lives that the history of Kenya is unravelled. The 283-page novel will take you through the multiparty era, the devastation of the 1998 bomb blast and the miracle-babies scandal, among many others that are all condensed and woven neatly into the lives of the three families.
The writer admitted during the book launch held at the Goethe Institute early this month that she grew up in South B, adding that for anyone who grew up in an estate, the story “practically wrote itself”, but was quick to clarify that the book was not based on her life."
Faith Oneya,"Women are said to have a stronger intuition than men. Where this intuition disappears to in matters religion is a mystery for the gods. You may have noticed that, since time immemorial, women have been the main target of abuse by some wolves in sheep’s clothing who masquerade as shepherds of their souls. It’s no coincidence that men don’t commonly feature as victims of religious cons. A 2016 Pew Research Centre report titled ‘The Gender Gap in Religion Around the World’ indicated that women, particularly Christians, are generally more religious than men. The report further said that in Kenya, women are 14 times more likely to attend religious services weekly than men. This means they remain more vulnerable to exploitation by religious leaders than men.
People like Pastor James Ng’ang’a of Neno Evangelism Centre rely on women to fill their pews and propagate their “miracles”. His latest scandal saw him penalised Sh1 million by the Communications Authority of Kenya for broadcasting indecent content during a watershed period. The story behind the penalty is that a female congregant’s breasts were exposed during a church service aired live on the pastor’s Sasa TV channel.
Truth be told, Ng’ang’a is not entirely to blame. He probably should not have been given a licence in the first place. Pick your metaphor to describe him, but one sure thing is that he has demonstrated time and again exactly who he is, so even in this instance, he was just pulling a Pastor Ng’ang’a."
Faith Oneya,"Four little words offered more gigantic insights about the HIV/Aids war than anything else so far in the studies conducted in recent times.
“Bring us the men,” said Dr Alberta Mirambeau from the Centers for Disease Control, citing the fact that since women have health-seeking tendencies and are mandatorily tested by hospitals when pregnant, they were easier to reach for testing than men.
She was speaking at the launch of a report titled Kenya Population-based HIV Impact Assessment 2018 by the National Aids and STI Control Programme (Nascop) last week. This poignant phrase pointed out what is perhaps the biggest impediment to the war against HIV/Aids: that while women are becoming more adaptive, men are becoming more rigid about finding out their HIV status.
The contrast is devastating because if testing is not done, then the right interventions can’t be made and that would be like going on reverse gear."
Faith Oneya,"The difference between the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) examination giants and the dwarfs (forgive the derogatory term) is that the latter will most likely laugh last, despite missing out on the coveted ‘A’ grade. The lives of these two groups are entwined, despite the grand efforts by the school system to demonstrate that academic excellence begets success in life.
A Daily Nation analysis of the results published on December 23 showed that 697,222 students sat the examination and 72 per cent of them attained “below-average” grades. It was certainly not a merry Christmas for the 504,415 candidates.
According to the Nation article, these “failed” candidates will join a growing population of school leavers who seek low-paying, poorly funded artisan courses or completely fall off the education system.
What a pity, you might say."
Faith Oneya,"It’s like Wakanda for creatives and the tech community. That is the only way one could sum up the 2019 African Crossroads event held in Mombasa. But unlike Wakanda, which is a fictional country located in sub-Saharan Africa and the home of superhero Black Panther, there was nothing imaginary about the event.
he annual gathering reflects on revolutionary, entrepreneurial, scientific, artistic and technological developments anchored in African intellectual and technological traditions.
The “vibranium” of African Crossroads was the rich diversity of the people the gathering brought together – 170 participants with different backgrounds and from 30 different countries.
The inaugural African Crossroads was held in Marrakesh, Morocco in December last year. This year’s ‘Sense the City’ theme asked the participating artists, entrepreneurs, computer scientists, designers, researchers, philosophers and thought leaders to come up with innovations and solutions that would bring positive change and advances to African cities. Discussions at the gathering were split into four tracks: taste (the future of food); sound, which wrestled with the idea of what is the sound of African cities; touch (focusing on fashion); and move (urban transport)."
Faith Oneya,"A bile-inducing incident starring ‘honourable’ members was the subject of much debate over the past week.
It came to the attention of the public through a widely shared video clip showing the members engaged in unhealthy debate as usual.
The stars of this latest episode of Politicians Behaving Badly were Didmus Barasa, Gladys Wanga and Esther Passaris.
What was unusual, however, was that during what seemed like a vitriolic, highly-charged exchange with the two female politicians, a visibly agitated Mr Barasa asked the Speaker, Justin Muturi, to protect him from the women.
“Yes, you are protected,” came the swift response.
“Cry me a river!” you may be tempted to shout, seeing as everybody was shouting, but Mr Barasa was not done yet."
Faith Oneya,"Maryam Sheikh Abdi was only six when she was “led to the slaughterhouse for the cut”. This is how she describes her Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) ordeal in her heart-wrenching poem, ‘The Cut’.
In the second stanza, she lays bare the conflict of emotions she went through: ‘Deep within me was the desire to be cut / as pain was my destiny: it is the burden of femininity / so I was told. These painful thoughts and the desire to fit in – even if it meant undergoing unimaginable pain – is shared by girls and women across the world.
Now in her 40s, Ms Abdi told the Daily Nation in a past interview that her community (she’s a devout Muslim from Somalia but grew up in Garissa) practices infibulation, which she explained is cutting out the clitoris and labia of a girl or woman and stitching together the edges of the vulva to prevent sexual intercourse. According to the World Health Organisation, infibulation is the most severe form of FGM. The mother of two said she hoped to see the day the world would be free of FGM but if Dr Tatu Kamau has anything to do with it, people like Ms Abdi and 200 million girls and women who have undergone the cut across the globe will not see that day.
In what will go down in history as one of the most outrageous and despicable acts against women, Dr Kamau, a physician, filed a bizarre petition to overturn Kenya’s Prohibition of Female Genital Mutilation Act in 2017."
Bitange Ndemo,"In the recent past, there have been very disturbing videos circulating, some showing Africans being bludgeoned in China.
There have also been claims of Africans being denied health services in the US and Europe.
The fact that none of these countries has come out to condemn such acts of discrimination confirms that indeed these ugly incidents continue unabated in a civilised world. Indeed, Malaysia does not even bother to hide racism as they explicitly deny Africans housing (see picture below). Do we really need diplomatic relationship with a country that is explicitly racist? On our part, it is shameful that we (individual countries and the African Union in particular) have not protested in the strongest terms possible that our citizens wherever they are, in whatever circumstances, should never be treated as though they were not human beings.
Our leaders have largely remained mum about mistreatment of their fellow citizens abroad because of our vulnerabilities based on our dependency on aid. We are also guilty of failure to manage and grow our economies.

"
Bitange Ndemo,"Although we have been celebrating modest growth and complimenting ourselves with celebratory phrases like Africa Rising, the Africans still consist of 70 per cent of the poor people in the world. A recent article, ‘Poverty in Africa is now falling—but not fast enough’, by Kristofer Hamel, Baldwin Tong, and Martin Hofer, in the Brookings Institute’s March 2019 issue says:
Africa is the world’s last frontier in the fight against extreme poverty. Today, one in three Africans—422 million people—live below the global poverty line. They represent more than 70 percent of the world’s poorest people.
An American private non-profit research organisation, the National Bureau of Economic Research’s April 15, 2020, publication reports that, “One half of the African continent lives below the poverty line. In sub-Saharan Africa, per capita GDP is now less than it was in 1974, having declined over 11 percent.”
Under vision 2030, it was argued that an average annual GDP growth of five per cent was not sufficient to see Kenya out of poverty and as such, we aimed for an annual growth rate of 10 per cent. Electoral violence has always undermined our progress. It therefore means that the key problem we ought to solve is political, before we tackle social and economic problems."
Bitange Ndemo,"Coronavirus has forced a pause on to the world. Strangely, the people, rich and poor, are yearning for normalcy to return. They want the world as they know it to be back.  
However, that world is shattered and may never return.
In the education sector, children are out of school, which gives us an opportunity to do good in this time.
There isn’t a single person in the world who knows when the pause will be over.  For now, we simply have to listen to Cristy Lane’s “One Day At A Time” song and in particular the following stanza to take it easy - One Day At A time:"

Yesterday's gone, sweet Jesus

Lord, help me today, show me the way
One day at a time
Although experts estimate that the crisis may take anywhere between twelve and eighteen months, people are anxious to get back in six months.
The Kenya National Union of Teachers have been vocal in demanding that government should not use schools to quarantine suspected Covid-19 carriers and that exams should be postponed. What do they know to make such demands?
We can do some good in education one day at a time before the crisis comes to an end.  By my estimation, there is a teacher in every village or estate in Kenya.
There are radios, televisions and smartphones in virtually every home. The entire country has broadband coverage.
These are the tools we need to facilitate a hackathon (dictionary.com defines it as “a sprint-like event; often, in which computer programmers and others involved in software development, including graphic designers, interface designers, project managers, domain experts, and others collaborate intensively on software projects.”) of content developers, in other words teachers creating content in their area of expertise."
Bitange Ndemo,"They can choose to enter the competition from wherever they are. They develop content from each module (subject topic) and a team of subject matter judges picks the top five.
The content will then be uploaded to a cloud (server) for delivery/broadcast through multiple platforms. Teachers wherever they are will spend a few days encouraging the students to leverage the online content to finish this year’s syllabus.
In the event the crisis takes twelve months or eighteen, there will be no anxieties about exams being postponed for the year. We can never recover lost time.
Curfews and lockdowns do not mean that we cannot use the time to do good. After all, it doesn’t make sense for people to stay idle for some unknown period and expect that the salaries continue to flow.
In my view, if there are teachers out there who love their job, this should be a pro bono exercise. Those whose content becomes popular can be paid based on the number of downloads.
Whilst the doctors are at the frontline fighting the virus, teachers should at the frontline through online platforms fighting ignorance and making the children busy.
The economists will do the same on the economy and all other professions will do the same to their calling. It doesn’t help waking up and doing nothing in the house.
When the universities started online teaching of the graduate programs, many criticised the move, saying it will not work. They said that traditional learning in classrooms is better than online. 
The emerging circumstances have changed the equation and we had to face reality. Two weeks into the program, most lecturers have overcome the initial hiccups. They are teaching to the extent that some students are wondering aloud why we always struggle through traffic jams to physically attend classes.
The next move is on how to deal with larger classes in the undergraduate programs.
Distance learning has evolved over the past three centuries to the current integration of digital technologies that have deeply influenced formal learning globally. 
Many of the teaching and learning platforms are free, making education today accessible and inclusive. This has truly democratised education such that with right policies, developing countries can greatly benefit their citizens."
Bitange Ndemo,"Experimentation at institutions of higher learning should give policymakers the impetus to introduce the same in primary and secondary schools to mitigate prevailing circumstances.  Moi Forces Academy Kiswahili teacher has shown the way by using a Zoom platform to successfully teach his students.
If the adoption goes well, it could even be introduced in adult education with some incentives. There are many people out there who missed the opportunity of learning, some not because of their choice.
The advent of technology in education has far-reaching implications. That those who had learning difficulty can very easily learn using artificial intelligence to orchestrate the interaction with the learner and provide customised resources and learning to address the unique needs of each learner.
Staying at home should not mean that it is a holiday of some sort. It is a time to reflect deeply with the aim to finding solutions to an emerging socio-economic problem.
After the virus, the world could possibly plunge into a recession. We can lessen that by doing what we’ve got to do, one day at a time."
Bitange Ndemo,"We watched as China confronted the coronavirus and as it threw everything it had at the virus.
We watched as the virus escaped to Korea, then to Europe and now in the US, and as the number of infections and deaths skyrocketed in Europe.
Then we started to see African countries confirm cases. If the trend is anything to go by, then in the next two to three weeks will be our turn to suffer. Like in the US, we thought the threat was minimal and this affected our decisiveness on response. Now, the number of infections is increasing.
It is as though this Covid-19 sends warning shots and then after 19 days, it comes with vengeance.
This, in my view, is a window that we must exploit by planning for: our homeless, food supply chains, our medical staffs’ protective gear, new sites for expanding hospital beds, medicines, emergency vehicles, people who rely on daily income.
Above all, we must candidly address our cultural practices on death and burial in light of this pandemic.
Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe said that Kenya has entered what is known as community infection stage, perhaps the worst stage along the continuum of infections considering that the virus can rapidly spread across the country if we fail in social distancing.
Lessons from Italy and Spain show that the only way of stopping the virus from spreading is through strict adherence to social distancing. Many countries have had to lockdown their countries as a strategy to distance themselves from mingling.
The chairman of the Council of Governors says that a total lockdown will bring misery to citizens. Others say the Governors are using the crisis as a bargaining chip to get more resources.
Either way, we are losing the valuable time to mitigate against the crisis. The more time we take to take action, the more we endanger the lives of people.

"
Bitange Ndemo,"Our context is more complicated than that of developed countries. We have more people crammed up in shanties. A quick decision to give incentives for those who can move to rural areas to do so is urgent. The more people we move from slums areas to rural areas, the better social distancing we create.
We also move the homeless to less densely populated areas, protect food supply chain companies from harassment by the police, establish a local industry to produce some hospital supplies and develop a public private partnership on emergency vehicles.
In as much as we are in a health crisis, some people must focus on the economy to fight off a possibility of economic collapse and further suffering.
Last week, McKinsey & Company published a report, Tackling Covid-19 in Africa: An unfolding health and economic crisis that demands bold action, highlighting their initial analysis of the pandemic’s economic impact.
Their findings show that Africa’s GDP growth in 2020 could reduce by 3–8 percentage points. The report says that in the absence of a major fiscal stimulus, the pandemic and the oil-price shock are likely to tip Africa into an economic contraction in 2020.
The report anticipates four likely scenarios for Africa. These include a scenario where the pandemic: is controlled in the near term, intensifies throughout the world, Asia, Europe and the US takes long to contain the epidemic and a significant outbreak in Africa with repercussion on the economy and lastly continued recovery in Asia, Europe and the US with significant outbreak in Africa."
Bitange Ndemo,"China is back to work barely three months after the advent of Covid-19. Their approach to dealing with the virus was criticised as “authoritarian.”
They, however, succeeded in eradicating the virus. The World Health Organization (WHO) praised China for its drastic response to the corona crisis.
Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan, having had an experience with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), made a quick decision to implement rigorous detection and strict quarantine measures.
In addition, citizens voluntarily locked themselves at home and worked from there. The governments banned mass gatherings. The people obeyed the directives without raising a voice.
Elsewhere in more democratic nation they called this behaviour “managed paternalism”.
In the meantime, the virus was spreading across the world. Italy, one of the hard-hit countries, took time to consider a lockdown. The leaders probably thought that the measures would be too drastic for a democratic country."
Bitange Ndemo,"The phrase “we can’t eat GDP growth” is becoming common in Africa.
It refers to a situation where there are economies recording GDP growth without development. Recorded economic growth rate is not translating into jobs.
Forty years ago, when I was in high school, economists told us that Africa had great potential. In virtually every conference I attend today, it is not uncommon to hear speakers say, Africa has got potential, signifying that little has changed.
This is said notwithstanding the fact that no one believes that we are doing enough to lessen widening inequalities.
The president of the African Development Bank (AfDB), Akinwumi Adesina laments that Africa’s food import bill will top $110 billion (Sh11 trillion) by 2025 up from $35 billion (Sh3.5 trillion) today. Why?
More people in Nigeria are sliding into poverty today than at any other period before.

Abigail Arunga,"I didn’t think it was entirely possible, but I did it anyway.
It’s so surprising how many things in our day-to-day life need Google to function. You don’t realise how many they are – until you have to do a whole day without them.
Think about it. When you wake up in the morning, you reach for your (probably) android phone. If you’re going to check out your route to work, you’re looking at it on Google Maps (have you checked out the new look Google Maps, by the way, in commemoration of their anniversary?). If you want to listen to some music during the day, you’ll likely listen to it on YouTube or Google Play – as you check your work email on – you guessed it – Gmail.
It was really hard for me to do an entire day without Google – and even in terms of commemoration, I failed at that a little bit too! I had to tweet about it, of course, because I am a millennial, and you know that with us, if there is no hashtag, it didn’t really happen (you can find the whole story on my Twitter. The hashtag I used was #ADayWithoutGoogle). So yes, I wrote about it. Writing about it, in fact, is what I did the whole day, because not being on Google makes work and life as a writer pretty impossible.
How can I not Google something about how to kill someone in the short story I am starting, or read the article about the Modern Love podcast on (ha!) Google Podcasts? As a creative – and maybe this differs across fields and careers – life without being able to fact check or double check is really, really hard. At some point, I just started to screenshot articles I was going to read on my Chrome browser on my phone, because apparently, as I quickly discovered, my laptop doesn’t seem to understand how to use Bing. Go figure.
It brings about a rather obvious question as we foray into the world of artificial intelligence and human dependence – which, as you can see, even if you look into your own life, is a prevalent trend. We already use computers and technology for so many things to make our lives easier – from apps like Calendar to plan and remind us about meetups to Assistant, for answering all the questions we’re too lazy to type, to following satellite-generated directions to places hours away that we’ve never been to. What does this mean for the human race? In the event of a Wall-E like apocalypse, would we even survive?"
Abigail Arunga,"I have a new favourite cute little café. It’s called the Pallet Café, and it is on James Gichuru Road. My favourite thing about it is that it is disability friendly – and by that I mean, all the servers are deaf.
There’s something distinctly beautiful about empathy, and people who try and make others aware that there are more people that don’t look like them in the world.
It’s a factor of privilege, I suppose – you grow up a certain way, around the same people, and you start assuming that everyone looks just like you and is just like you. That is quite obviously not always the case. When you walk into Pallet, you will notice a stand on the side that indicates the sign language alphabet. This will be handy for you while ordering, even though you can do the boring thing and point at the menu – which is also fine."
Abigail Arunga,"After Always had a terrible experience with Kenyan women, they decided to roll out a new brand of pads that encapsulate an improvement on the previous ones they were flooding the Kenyan market with.
Granted, not everyone uses Always (although, statistically, most people who use pads in this country start with Always). And again, not everyone who uses Always suffers in the same way the people on the Twitter streets were suffering.
But the ones who were suffering were very loud about it. There were complaints of rashes, weird overly perfumed odours and general irritation.
Always decided that the first best thing to do was to get influencers to back up their product – which, by the way, was a terrible idea. That’s mistake 101 – gas-lit advertising. Don’t try and make it sound like the people who are complaining have no idea of what they’re talking about, and are part of a select few who are just complainers by nature. Don’t get people with larger followings who are sticking to the script of a brief defend your brand. Who thought that failure up?
Then, their next grand master plan was to roll out this new product. As yet, I haven’t heard any rave reviews on the product yet, perhaps because the trust from the last public debacle is still lacking. Sanitary towels are actually a very sensitive subject to women – whether we are talking about the lack of towels, the offending taxes put on towels, the unavailability of towels (and tampons) or how bad the ones available are. Which is why it surprises me that Always brushed aside women’s concerns so quickly, and continue to do so.
Why do I say that they continue to do so? Because no one wants a new Always product – do they? I certainly don’t. I didn’t ask for a new repackaging or a whole different pad. No need to reinvent the wheel. All Kenyan women want is to be given sanitary products that match the quality of the ones that they are so willing to produce for first world countries. Surely we deserve at least that respect?
There are a number of reasons why they can say they are not doing this – perhaps it costs too much to manufacture. Or maybe distribution would be too complicated. But telling us this tripe that the quality is the same as it is abroad – when we have samples and testimonies to disprove this – is quite simply, taking us for fools.
Perhaps the global south is not much to the first world, but we can at least speak with our few shillings and not stand for this treatment. There are local brands that are readily available and willing to treat Kenyans like valued customers. Someone tell Always that almost doesn’t count. Someone tell Always that almost doesn’t count."
Abigail Arunga,"You probably know her on Instagram as @hujabi_villain, but her name is Faiza Hemed.
Faiza is a former accountant-turned digital media specialist and content creator whose experience involves writing, producing and hosting entertainment video content. Here is her story:
1. Why does the nature of online comedy appeal to you, and when did you venture into it?
I've always been on the pursuit of a good laugh. I believe you can get through anything in life with a sense of humour.
After quitting my accounting job, I landed a job at a digital media company about three years back and that's when my colleague Cherie Lindiwe discovered she could make something out of the laughs we had in the office daily.
However, I wouldn't classify what I do online as comedy — it's more of satire because at the end of the day, there's a lesson to be learnt from the content I produce."
Abigail Arunga,"If you are anything like a typical Nairobian, you have no plans to do anything or go anywhere for Christmas Day. That is, if you haven’t been planning to go somewhere from the beginning of the year. If you're those planners, this isn’t for you.
This is for the people who are just as disorganised as me. The people who thought they didn’t want to do anything, but are now getting caught up in the drama and excitement of the holiday season.
Those people who thought they would be fine sitting at home, but are now looking longingly at pictures of people on Instagram. I can tell you how to make people look at your pictures longingly on Christmas or New Year’s Eve, too. Not that the point is social media – but green is a great colour on someone else, when it isn’t on you.
And I guarantee this method works! I would know, I tried it out last week, when I went to Radisson Blu in Upper Hill to sample a few of the delicacies they’re going to have on offer on New Year’s Eve.
So let me start with the price tag, which you’ll need to pay ASAP, seeing as the places are filling up fast (it’s Radisson. Of course spaces are filling up fast. Call 0791427917, like, yesterday)."
Abigail Arunga,"TI is coming to Kenya, and as is the case when a problematic man insists on coming to do a concert here, I am extremely conflicted.
On the one hand, it has always been clear to me that if R Kelly ever comes to Kenya, there would be no debate whatsoever about whether or not I would go to his concert. It is a no-brainer – in that I will not be going. Going for an R Kelly concert, for me, would be tantamount to agreeing with what he is doing, and has been doing, to underage girls, since he was in his 20s – assaulting them, using them, brainwashing them and raping them (which is what it is – it is statutory rape when someone the victim is underage). And in some cases, like Aaliyah’s, marrying them.
Of course, his perverted habits did not exist in a vacuum. There are equally horrible people who helped him to do these things – Aaliyah’s uncle, for example, who first introduced the pair to each other, regardless of the fact that he knew Kelly’s reputation.
To this day, her uncle, Barry Hankerson, has refused to release any of Aaliyah’s musical catalogue to the public, and therefore, the only music available to stream is her very first album – the Kelly-produced, incredibly gross wink to their ongoing relationship at the time, Age Ain’t Nothing But a Number. And then there’s that fact: that his music directly sings about what he was doing to this women. Kelly was leaving hints about his behaviour all over the place, unabashedly, unashamed. Chris Brown, for another example, came to Kenya, and I did go to the concert. I’m not sure what possessed me at the time, but I think I separated myself from his deeds by telling myself that he had done his time, for his misdeeds. And he was quite young at the time, and according to his documentary, he and Rihanna were violent towards each other (but no one boycotted Rihanna). And his jail time didn’t make a difference, because he continued to be violent to women and men alike after he was locked up.
So clearly the guy hasn’t changed. So why did I go for his concert, and how is he different? Both men have sustained violent histories. Both are extremely talented.
The same can be said of TI who is extremely talented and extremely problematic as well. I don’t know that I would want to give him my money. I feel like, before, his drama was bubbling under the surface, from songs like No Mediocre to touting Iggy Azalea as the forefront female rapper of his label, in spite of her nonsensical put on Southern accent and basically black-facing her music. He has since retracted these comments."
Abigail Arunga,"If there is any doubt that Kenyans are obsessed with wombs, policing women’s bodies and what people do in their bedrooms, that doubt has been completely eliminated by the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD25). Kenyans are, indeed, obsessed.
The summit taking place in Nairobi marks 25 years since the first one where international bodies and governments agreed that access to proper sexual and reproductive healthcare information and services, as well as family planning services, are essential for women, and for development.
But with all the propaganda that is flying around, from a parallel conference by major churches, to social media, to videos by angry Caucasian pseudo-Christians, you would think that ICPD is trying to sanction nationwide orgies and scenes resembling the movie The Purge, where anarchy and murder reign. Perhaps it is the contrasting messaging. The fact that the government, and the president himself, allowed this conference to happen in Nairobi, would imply that he doesn’t actually have as big a problem with the conference as earlier indicated – contrary to statements he made last week. Then, the undue focus on pre and post natal care ignores everything else that the conference is addressing – like stopping FGM, for example, and ending maternal mortality – which, in spite of a dozen marathons or so, remains at an alarming statistic.
The facts: the government, by its own admission, owes the citizens of Kenya, basic healthcare, and sexual and reproductive health information and services. This does indeed involve talking about sex, its effects, and making sure that those who need hospitals can access them, for consultation and drugs if necessary. This is what Form Ni Gani was pushing for, this year and last year – the fact that the Constitution of Kenya 2010 guarantees the right to the highest standard reproductive health"" and the Health Act of 2017 guarantees safe, effective and affordable family planning for all Kenyan adults. Where is that safe, effective and affordable family planning, for all adults?"
Abigail Arunga,"It's the morning after. The birds are chirping. The sun has risen in its glory. Traffic has already begun to recover from the holiday to prepare for yet another holiday. The weekend is here. But once again, Ngugi Wa Thiong'o's much anticipated Nobel Prize for Literature, is not.
Ngugi is arguably the father of modern Kenyan literature and mother tongue psychology, and its impact on our cultures. He has been at the forefront, insisting that we write for ourselves, in our own languages, and has led the charge in this respect as well, literally putting his money and lifeblood where his mouth is. He is also an exiled hero, for dancing with these ideals, and a sorrowful but not complete returnee to the land whose leader rejected him, the land that insists he be awarded this prize (forget all the others) so they can acknowledge he whom we shunned. Year after year, we watch, irritated, as this legend is passed over, often for someone we deem unworthy or unknown. A country singer cum activist. A rapper who is said to be the reincarnation of Tupac. A...who?
The rage is fresh every year, but never unprecedented. It is an old and tiring wound that only flares up against the cold winds of arrogance. Surely, the world knows who Ngugi Wa Thiong'o is, and understands the place he holds in the hearts of every Kenyan schoolchild who either fell asleep to his rhetoric or greatly decided to be him? Surely they see that he deserves this? No, they don't, and they don't care. Unfortunately, we Africans are still addicted to validation outside of our own borders, which, funnily enough, does not sustain the lives and independences we are searching for. Because we have not decolonised our minds, as Ngugi has told us to do several times, we're still gutted when he is, once again, not mentioned as winner. We're gutted. Slighted. Angry. All valid feelings, but predominantly insignificant to the people who decide these sorts of things for us.
And that's where the problem lies. Someone is deciding this stuff for us. We're not doing it for ourselves, and we're clearly not done sycophantically pleading our case. A Nobel cannot and should not be the measure of what a good writer is, nor is it given to who is actually the best writer in the world, does it. If that were true, Ngugi would have stopped ages ago to become something safer with a better pension."
Abigail Arunga,"I think someone needs to look into the boredom levels of our MPs.
Something is clearly going on there, and I say this because of the recent dearth of bills they seem to be putting forward.
Dearth might be the wrong word – maybe the right word is, the lack of any sort of coherent thought process involved in what they are suggesting into law. The proposals before us are not only unimaginative and unnecessary in this clime, but also just…well, boring.
There was the appalling one from last week, about WhatsApp groups. Apparently the government wants to monitor all such groups in Kenya.
I won’t beat the dead horse again about how there are so many other things that our parliamentarians need to, and should, be focusing on – people dying, incoming famines, useless Huduma numbers, the whole lot. What I will focus on is the sheer impracticality of trying to monitor social media.
Social media is a monster of its own making, with or without the encrypting that WhatsApp offers. Because it is such a diverse offering, in that you have so many platforms – Facebook, Tinder, YouTube, Twitter, Snapchat, Instagram, TikTok, among so very many others – unless you’re the creator of such a platform, you really can’t regulate what goes on therein. And unless there is some international Cambridge Analytica-scale data breach going on that I don’t know about, I don’t know how the government will be able to regulate Kenya’s social media. And if there is a data breach – well, someone is getting sued."
Abigail Arunga,"There is a video of a child reacting to being bullied by his classmate that is doing rounds on social media. He calls the alleged bully all manner of names and uses Love and Hip Hop type phrases because this little girl called him gay.
I personally could not watch the video to the very end. Obviously it seemed contrived – this kid is using words he sees on television, and introductions from a classic YouTube channel to put his point across, somehow. But using adult words doesn’t make him an adult at all – not in any sense of the word. This kid is acting in a fashion that he deems to be cool, or appropriate, to the point that even after the furore was caused from the video, his apology doesn’t necessarily sound like something he meant. The whole thing is disturbing.
Then there is the bigger problem that the video points to that no one seems to be paying attention to – the fact that bullying can push someone so far as to threaten to kill someone else in their classroom, which, I suppose, is how these American shootings happen? At the end of the video, this child says that he’s coming for his classmate, and will shoot her in the face. I know kids can be pretty horrible to each other – I’ve been a kid. I remember all too well being bullied by people larger or cooler than me, and I remember the levels of desperation I felt in trying to get away from these bullies, by any means necessary. I remember feeling like teachers wouldn’t help – and indeed, in many instances, they mocked the ‘weaker’ kids for tattling to the administration, which I can tell you for free did not encourage a whistle-blowing attitude. If I had had access to a gun or a knife – or a mobile phone to air my grievances – I can’t say that I wouldn’t have done the same thing. Being a minor is hard enough without victimisation from parents, teachers and peers – as you know if you’ve been reading the papers about the little girl who committed suicide because her teacher made fun of her period.
That’s how these suicides happen. That’s how these videos happen. A kid is pushed so close to the edge that the only way they see out is extreme measures - like these ones: using adult language to talk about things they don’t understand. Killing themselves because they genuinely don’t see a way out of the misery. They never think it is possible that high school or primary school will ever end. They think the torture and the shame is forever."
