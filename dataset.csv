Faith Oneya,"The clumsiness of responses to the plight of learners by the Ministry of Education amid the global Covid-19 pandemic has exposed the painful reality of a government willing to eat its own children.

The ministry has issued an avalanche of dubious, contradictory policies ever since schools were closed in March, throwing learners into confusion at every turn.

It turns out that the problem is beyond what even the tough-talking CS Prof George Magoha could have imagined possible. He recently said powerful forces, including cartels in his ministry, are behind the pressure to reopen schools before the Covid-19 curve flattens. Surprise, surprise.

The chilling, unspoken reality in his words is that our children are on our own, for the ministry certainly can’t help them. But this does not absolve them of the responsibility of putting the safety and welfare of learners at the centre of every decision which affects them, cartels or no. In pushing for the haphazardly put together, logistically unhinged community-based learning (CBL) programme, and telling teachers and learners that they would not provide PPEs, the ministry demonstrated that they do not care about our children.

The intentions for the community learning programme are noble. You could even say they are as noble as the phantom Jubilee Laptops project.

The programme is supposed to “impart life skills like cultivating, weeding, grazing, hygiene, and storytelling” before schools reopen.

If you are wondering why a child who lives in an eight-storey building in Nairobi needs to learn how to cultivate, weed and graze, good for you! You are doing something that’s been excruciatingly rare for those in authority.

The High Court has temporarily halted the roll-out of CBL after a petition by a parent. But before this, the ministry had a different knee-jerk reaction: the virtual learning programme which only served to expose the digital inequality of learners. Even children can tell that there are gaps in the plans so far. Joy Lorna Adhiambo, the 14-year-old Lugulu Girls student “teacher” featured in the Saturday Nation a few weeks ago, demonstrated what one could do for learners with a little empathy and creativity. “Teacher Joy” started a makeshift school where she takes her “students” through lessons and helps them with their homework. Her goal is simple: to keep the neighbourhood children busy and engaged.

Perhaps the ministry should have “Teacher” Joy sit on their advisory board to tell them what children really want.

The safety and of our children will take a concerted effort from teachers, parents and government; the responsibility remains with the ministry.

As we creep closer to the peak in Covid-19 infections, we can’t afford to participate in the games the ministry wants us to play with our children.

If every ounce of creativity and empathy has been squeezed out of the ministry, then let the children stay home."
Faith Oneya,"The cardinal rule in the bible of corruption is, “Thou shalt not get caught”.

The Tourism ministry broke it when it was called out for appointing Pauline Njoroge as a member of the Tourism Regulatory Authority (TRA) board.

Social media pundits pulled out an undated post in which she had proposed that the land the Nairobi National Park sits on be put to “better and more profitable use”, prompting Cabinet Secretary Najib Balala to revoke her appointment.

His explanation? The ministry had just learnt of her past remarks about the park and could not associate itself with her. Yet we know information peddlers, especially the ones who make things go viral – like Edgar Obare and Robert Alai – are always on the government’s radar screen.

The question the ministry needs to answer is how her name got on the list in the first place. This might have been what prompted the Law Society of Kenya (LSK) to go to court questioning the validity of four of the TRA board appointments.

 In the petition, they argued that the appointments were “unconstitutional, unlawful and illegal because they were done in total disregard of procedural, constitutional and statutory requirements”.

Ms Njoroge’s name was one of them. Don’t believe the hyped-up demonstration of innocence by the government. Ms Njoroge’s website portrays a nirvana of information-sharing via social media.

 She claims to use it to “engage her followers on important happenings in Africa and their impact on the masses and also to advocate for Africa’s economic and political agenda”.

But her record tells a different story. Ms Njoroge’s stand as a peddler of the Jubilee government propaganda is well-known, having gained popularity during President Uhuru Kenyatta’s election campaigns in 2013 and 2017. It’s also worth noting that she received a Head of State Commendation in 2017. She trades in hard-nosed salvos. The government has always known and profited from them. Ms Njoroge’s case was hailed as a lesson on how not to use social media, but it’s the opposite.

She deserves to be a case study on how to nail social media use for personal and professional profit.

She should hold masterclasses on the subject. Mr Balala admitted, in a meeting with stakeholders in February 2020, that the move by the government in 2016 to have a railway line pass through the national park was a big mistake, adding that it would not have happened on his watch.

 This means he was watching and listening all along. So here we are, faced with an award-winning social media warrior whose words against the Nairobi National Park mirrored the government’s position at the time in allowing the standard gauge railway line encroach on a public green space and a CS who feigns ignorance. Just who’s fooling whom?"
Faith Oneya,"The phrase ‘starving artist’ doesn’t make too many people uncomfortable because our society and culture are rigged to ensure that it remains accurate.

A week ago, the Artcaffé chain of restaurants attempted to change this narrative by making a scandalous offer: free coffee and exposure of artistic work. The artists would get to showcase their art on coffee cups.

They sweetened the deal with an internship. Artcaffé was just doing what the Romans do, with a nicotine twist to keep the artists alert and compliant.

Kenyans were rightly infuriated by the offer. But the truth is that no amount of mathematics wizardry can tell you how many coffee cups it takes to declare an artist non-starving. So until that formula is passed, one can safely assume the only template Artcaffé was working with was the culture they had witnessed around art in Kenya: that it’s often treated as something to be enjoyed but not paid for. They might have thought they were doing artists a favour by offering to pay “something small”, a phrase that’s just a euphemism for: “You won’t afford your next meal with this payment”.

Had we ignored the ruckus for a minute, looked into our cups and attended to the root of the indignation, we would have discovered that Artcaffé is not the problem. We are.

The starving artist narrative starts at home, where parents discourage children from pursuing art because they will starve to death. In school, art is often sidelined and rarely associated with the success of a learner. On leaving the school system, artists come face to face with a society conditioned to expect art to be either free or dirt cheap. People will ooooh and aaaah at the artist’s photograph, painting, film, book, pottery or music but baulk when asked to pay for it.

If Kenyans truly supported art, then artists would not be continuously forced to fight the piracy monster. Joe Khamisi, a distinguished parliamentarian, lost the battle to piracy, and subsequently his royalties in 2018. His book, Kenya: Looters and Grabbers: 54 Years of Corruption and Plunder by the Elite, 1963 – 2017, was grabbed online and circulated for free. Anyone who shamelessly consumes or distributes illegally acquired online copies of books, music and other forms of art is complicit in the starvation of artists. Any bystander who doesn’t find a problem with this is the problem.

The creativity of artists will never grind to a halt if we keep exploiting their talent, but their motivation certainly will.

We don’t want that to happen, especially not at such a time when the Covid-19 pandemic has cast a pall of anxiety and misery over everything and art has been a source of relief and healing for many. Art can’t flourish where it isn’t valued. Let’s appreciate it by putting our money where our mouths are."
Faith Oneya,"""Close your legs!"" used to be a common phrase in Kenyan households when mothers and fathers berated little girls for not sitting “properly”.  Girls would demurely put their legs together, mortified that they had broken one of the unwritten rules on how to be a girl, and learning quickly that shame was part of the deal.

“Close your legs!” is an insidious phrase. To begin, what on earth does sitting with closed legs have to do with being a girl? Plenty, as we’ll soon find out. Hint: It’s not really about legs.

When the statement is peeled back, one realises that it is intertwined with morality, and inadvertently, sex. Good girls keep their legs closed.

“Close your legs” came to mind recently when NTV aired a clip on the Funga Miguu initiative in Kajiado South sub-county, termed as “a provocative and bold initiative that seeks to stomp out unplanned pregnancies in the area” in response to the rising cases of teenage pregnancies reported during the pandemic. If all that was in the communication brief was to just provoke people, then the spin doctor or whoever was in charge deserves a standing ovation.

But if the intention was to inspire teenage girls to “close their legs”, then they need to rewrite the script and mind their language.  Stigma and shame are a constant reality for pregnant teenage girls and such language only perpetuates this.

The reality constructed by a phrase like “Funga Miguu” (literally translated to ‘Close Your Legs’) is that girls are the problem.  More accurately, that the girls’ legs are the problem, metaphorically speaking.  It forces a warped narrative that the sometimes traumatic experiences of the girls boil down to the closing of their legs. If this manipulation of reality caused by the phrase doesn’t worry the good people of Kajiado South sub-county, then the problem is bigger than just language.

Poverty, sexual violence and forced marriages have continually been cited as some of the leading causes of teenage pregnancies in developing countries like Kenya so any language that puts the girls at the centre of the blame needs to be rejected. According to Plan International, teenage pregnancy increases when girls are denied the right to make decisions about their sexual and reproductive health and well-being.

The Funga Miguu people can be of better service to their community if they changed their language to reflect this reality. Girls don’t need to be told to close their legs. It’s the perpetrators of sexual violence who need to be told to zip up.

The real revolution will happen when we stop shaming pregnant teenage girls and start empowering them by providing them with the knowledge and information they need to navigate the choppy waters of life.  We can start that revolution by minding our language."
Faith Oneya,"If you want a sense of what public stigma against people with mental illness looks like, a decent place to start is the news coverage and overall reactions to American rapper Kanye West’s erratic tweets in July.

One rant that stood out was when he launched his presidential campaign in a disjointed speech. He later accused his family members of all kinds of evil.

His Tweets were fodder for news outlets, a majority of whom were catering to the insatiable appetites of their audience. More controversy. More entertainment. More spectacle.

The issue is that his tweets were taken at face value. Some social media users derived great pleasure from making fun of what he said. Memes were created and shared. Fun and entertainment was chosen repeatedly over compassion and understanding. The rapper has opened up in the past about his struggle with bipolar disorder. According to the World Health Organization, it typically consists of both manic and depressive episodes separated by periods of normalcy. His wife, Kim Kardashian, referred to the illness as “complicated and painful”.

In an ideal world, the context of his mental illness should have been shared alongside his tweets, especially by news outlets because they owe it to the public. This would have gone a long way in fighting stereotypes and stigma.

Former World Boxing Association middleweight champion Conjestina Achieng’s story takes a similar trajectory. She has fought schizophrenia in the full glare of a public that doesn’t have a reputation for understanding her invisible enemies. Her family has suffered the burden of the injustice of public stigma.

Long before politicians used her situation for photo and publicity opportunities, videos of the boxing champion speaking erratically circulated on social and mainstream media, demonstrating once again an acute lack of empathy and understanding whenever someone struggles with mental illness. One of the assumptions about mental illness is that it’s something to snap out of at will.

More recently, the Daily Nation reported that the pandemic was driving Kenyans into the jaws of mental health issues. Psychiatrist Dr Frank Njenga later reiterated this, expressing concern about the stigma associated with mental illness. “People are so afraid and shy of indicating that they suffer from depression or any other mental health illness that they would rather stay with their illnesses at home than expose themselves to the shame of confirming that they are humans and suffer from mental illnesses,” he said, adding that there is need to establish structures and systems to deal with stigma. If what awaits them is mockery and dismissal, who can blame them?

Let’s spare some compassion and understanding for our brothers and sisters suffering from mental illnesses. It’s the least we can do."
Faith Oneya,"‘Sorry’ can be a powerful word, especially when divorced from defensiveness, blame-shifting and rationalisations. One of the most significant moments in Australian history is when the then-Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, delivered the ‘Sorry Speech’ in Parliament in 2008.

He apologised to Australia’s indigenous people for decades of suffering and mistreatment. Here’s an excerpt: To the mothers and the fathers, the brothers and the sisters, for the breaking up of families and communities, we say sorry / And for the indignity and degradation thus inflicted on a proud people and a proud culture, we say sorry.

If nothing else, the apology is a study in how to say sorry. For when done right, it can lay the foundation for deep, meaningful reflection and healing.

Our local politicians don’t do too well with apologies, as Nairobi Senator Johnson Sakaja proved recently when he was caught flouting Covid-19 rules.

After denying the allegations of being arrested through his Twitter account, he eventually owned up to his mistake, marrying his apology with a plethora of justifications and excuses. The cherry on the top? A resignation from his position as the chairman of the Senate ad hoc committee on Covid-19. “I apologise to Kenyans and accept full responsibility for my actions and I will present myself in court tomorrow. I have asked to be shown what I will be charged with; they are saying it is violation of curfew orders and I am saying that it is true. I am not trying to make an excuse,” he said. How’s that for ‘sorry’? Remember, he’s not ‘trying’ to make an excuse. He is in fact, making an excuse!

He’s not to blame. He knew he was forgiven even before he graced our TVs with an apology. That’s how generous and predictable Kenyans are. Perhaps it’s grace. Or naivety. Or apathy. One might also argue that nobody was actually given the opportunity to refuse the apology.

Having the opportunity to apologise for flouting Covid-19 rules is a privilege. Remember a little boy called Yusuf Moyo? Such senseless deaths are what Mr Sakaja and his political peers like Kasipul MP Ong’odo Were, who have no qualms about flouting Covid-19 rules, should be sorry for.

A section of Kenyans went on social media to express their support for the senator, especially when he resigned. Media personality DJ Soxxy captioned a photo of the resignation letter with the phrase “This is leadership”, earning mixed reactions. But it’s a comment by writer Kinyanjui Kombani which caught my attention. “Leadership is taking full responsibility by resigning as a senator. Leadership is asking hard questions, like why do some people get off with a 15k fine and others shot to death. Sorry, resigning from an ad-hoc committee that we didn't even know existed is not leadership?”

His comments attracted the venom of some Kenyans, who could not understand why an apology was not enough. Here’s an attempt at answering that:

Mr Sakaja's “Sorry” amidst surging numbers of Covid-19 points to the endemic and systemic impunity that we have come to accept as part of our culture. Politicians have little to worry about, now that some of them have already installed ventilators in their homes, unwilling to participate in any agitation for better public healthcare that would benefit their fellow Kenyans who depend on God-given lungs for air.

Writing about what it means to be sorry, Dr Carl Schneider says what makes an apology work is the exchange of shame and power between the offender and the offended, with the person apologising putting himself at the mercy of the offended party. This did not happen in Mr Sakaja’s case.

For anyone who says to err is human, you are absolutely right. But even the sincerest of apologies can’t undo damage that’s done. Time is ripe for us to turn a new page in how quickly we dish out forgiveness and how little we demand of our leaders."
Faith Oneya,"“Where is the love?” is a question that won’t cease as the Covid-19 pandemic rages on, leaving ugly stains on humanity.

The lyrics in Black Eyed Peas’ song by the same title would fit perfectly in the current situation: People killin' people dyin'/ Children hurtin', I hear them cryin'/ Can you practice what you preachin'?

Our children are not safe. They are either labouring hard somewhere or being hunted down by sex predators. Our women are not safe; they are dying at the hands of their partners. Experts have warned stress from social isolation is exacerbating tensions and increasing ""the risk of domestic and sexual violence against women and children"". Our men are not safe; they are being shot dead by the police for the flimsiest of reasons. Health workers  are not safe either. They recently buried one of their own, Dr Doreen Lugaliki, who died of Covid-19 complications. But the pandemic has also been an education in humanity

Because despite all the dreariness, a most unlikely hero (or villain, depending on your perspective) has emerged: the landlord. Perhaps the relationship between the landlord and tenant has become even more special because people have been forced to stay at home for longer periods than they are used to. Additionally, shelter is a basic need that Kenyans who have been rendered jobless by the pandemic can hardly afford.

Landlords have starred in some of the most heart-wrenching and heart-warming stories to come out of the pandemic. As some of them ignore the basic tenets of humanity by kicking out hungry, crying children, women and men and from their houses over rent arrears, some are restoring faith in humanity by taking extraordinary measures to make sure they are on the right side of history.

Alvan Gatitu, an actor and singer, knows the pain of being forced to sleep out in the cold because of rent arrears. In a viral video, he claimed that his landlord switched off his electricity and water for two-and-a-half weeks. He added that a friend who promised to host him asked the watchmen not to let him in. Where was the love? In Nairobi’s Kayole estate, 16 families were forced to spend the night in the cold after their landlord evicted them over rent arrears. One of the most shocking incidents, however, came from Nanyuki, courtesy of Jane Wamucii’s landlord. He removed the roof and door of her house, leaving her and her three children out in the cold. The landlords who take such extreme actions justify them by citing loans and their right to demand what’s theirs. Really?

However, for every tragic story, there's one with a happy ending. Take Mr Michael Munene, a landlord who waived rent for his tenants for four months and told them to focus on providing food for themselves and their families, adding that if the pandemic persisted, he would “see what to do”.

Mr Justus Eleman went to the same humanity school as Mr Munene. The Lodwar Town resident waived April rent totalling Sh66,000. He said the tenants had been consistent in paying rent and it was his time to show solidarity.

People like Mr Munene and Mr Eleman deserve acknowledgement as heroes. While we can’t all be landlords, those of us privileged to have a source of income can do that one little thing that will mean a meal for someone who would have slept hungry otherwise.

Like Victor Edalia who started Kibera Organic Gardens that supplies vegetables to at least 10 needy families on a weekly basis. It may be a long time before the economy starts humming again and it’s such kind acts that will keep all of us going. Research has also shown that kindness boosts happiness and wellbeing.

Let kindness to one another be the legacy of this pandemic. Start now. Moral excellence, as philosopher Aristotle said, comes about as a result of habit."
Faith Oneya,"The ‘antis’ and ‘pros’ of the Reproductive Healthcare Bill 2019 have much more in common than they would care to admit.

At the molten core of the fiery arguments about who’s right and who’s wrong lies a genuine desire to act in the best interest of those for whom the Bill is literally a matter of life and death: vulnerable girls, women and children (born and unborn).

Those girls and women for whom there will probably be no space for them to exercise these rights even if the Bill was passed into law. Those for whom a pregnancy complication signifies death of the child. Or mother. Or both.

It has been prejudicially labelled the ‘Abortion Bill’ by the ‘antis’, replete with an online petition to reject it. One such faction, the Evangelical Alliances of Kenya, argued that it normalises underage sex and encourages same-sex marriages. “If we allow sexual pleasure to be taught as a right, what happens when one wants the pleasure, and there’s no consenting partner of the opposite sex?” posed Bishop Kepha Omae, a member of the group, during a press briefing.

The answer for the ‘antis’ clearly lies in the rejection of the Bill. Yet it’s a fact that no amount of piousness can effectively control sexual urges, whether towards the same sex or not. Besides, underage sex still persists even under the watch of parents and guardians.

Let’s face it: there really can’t be a middle ground on matters sex or sexuality so this is not an argument for consensus on these topics. But because it’s the best interest of our girls and women, and by extension the unborn children, it’s critical for the ‘antis’, to draw from the Bill the potentially useful and empowering qualities that will promote these interests, even while rejecting the bits that seem to prick their morality. They might be difficult and painful concessions but they are necessary. It’s not about them.

Nakuru County senator Susan Kihika, who proposed the Bill, called this reaction by the ‘antis’ “misinformation, malice and intended to whip the emotions of the public”, adding that it’s just a reproductive healthcare Bill which does not encourage rape, underage sex or same sex marriage, as insinuated by members of the clergy. In an interview with Daily Nation, she emphasised that the State has a duty to ensure women and girls with disabilities have equal access to health care services.

Even if she is right, the person for whom the Bill is intended would probably listen to her pastor more than she would her politician. And one would be hard pressed to find a semi-literate girl or woman in the village using her evenings to catch up with the latest clauses in the Bill.

Civil society groups who have shown their support for the Bill have also been dismissed as having their own “NGO agenda to push” by the ‘antis’.

The other thing the ‘pros’ and ‘antis’ have in common is access to information and knowledge about the Bill. Trapped in their own convictions, they sometimes forget that the people for whom they claim to be fighting so hard for do not have the knowledge privilege that they do. The information in the Bill about access to family planning services, right to reproductive health information, right to assisted reproduction and safe motherhood should be shared without any spin to suit the agenda of either side. This means it needs to reach Wanjiku minus emotions, propaganda and exaggerations.

For the ‘antis’, the staggering numbers of maternal deaths, teenage pregnancies and unsafe abortions should be the jolt they need to take a sober look at the Bill. These realities should be what both factions respond to, as they probably won’t listen to each other.

The tension between those for and against the Bill can only be useful if women and girls remain at the centre of it. After all, as the Swahili say, when two bulls fight, it’s the grass that bears the brunt."
Faith Oneya,"It is obvious that love flows freely and abundantly in this household. From the warm and easy-going manner Priscilla Kanini interacts with everyone, you would never guess that she is the househelp.

George Kamau, 65, and his wife of 41 years, Veronica Wanjiru, 61, have lived with Priscilla Kanini, 51, for the last 33 years. She started working for them when she was only 18 years old.

The Kamaus have five children: John Mbugua, twins Allan Kamau and Helimah Muchiri, and another set of twins, Susan Otieno and Lawrence Njoroge, though they consider Priscilla’s only child, Martha Mbeke, one of their own. Martha, their ‘adopted’ child, has lived with the Kamaus since she was two years old.

She is now 28 years old, and will be getting married later this year. This unique story began in 1982 when Veronica was looking for someone to help take care of her last two children, Susan and Lawrence.

By then, she had lost count of the number of househelps she had employed. No one, it seemed, was a match for her family.

In frustration, she approached a friend who managed the Salvation Army hostels in Kariakor, and informed her that she was looking for a live-in help.

Priscilla had just completed a course in cooking, cleaning and other domestic chores, at the Nairobi Girls’ Centre in Kariakor, run by the Salvation Army, and was looking for a job.

She says,

“I had prayed to get a job with a family I could get along with. I promised God that if he granted me my prayer, I would work as if working for Him.”

When Veronica met Priscilla, she immediately had a good feeling about her. “My first impression of her was that she was respectful: after a few days of working for us, I could see that she was also hardworking and loyal, qualities that have not changed for the 33 years she has worked for us,” Veronica says, looking at Priscilla fondly.

George, Veronica’s husband, was also impressed.

 “When Priscilla came to live with us, the immediate difference I felt was that my wife quarrelled less – she became calmer and more settled,” he says with a hearty laugh.

Four years later, in 1987, Veronica noticed that Priscilla was behaving in a “strange” manner.

“Priscilla was generally a poor feeder, but then I noticed that she was not eating at all. She would also sweat profusely while working, especially while ironing clothes, something that got me very concerned. I decided to approach the friend who had recommended her to work for me. I wanted to find out whether she had complained of any health complications,” she says.

When her friend came, it did not take her long to diagnose the ‘condition’ Priscilla was suffering from. She was pregnant. “I can still see my friend laughing at me even now, she laughed so hard, amused that after five children, I could not tell that Priscilla was pregnant.” 

Some employers would have dismissed her immediately, but Veronica allowed Priscilla to continue working until the last trimester of her pregnancy, then sent her on maternity leave.

When she gave birth to her baby girl, Martha, Veronica decided to take the young family to her mother’s home in Kiambu, where she felt that mother and child would get better care, until Priscilla was strong enough to start working again.

Priscilla and her daughter lived with Veronica’s mother until Martha turned two, and then they returned to their home in Kambiti, Makuyu. 

Lasting relationship

Meanwhile, Veronica was yet to get a reliable helper. One day, she came back home, only to find her then seven-year-old  son, Allan, looking agitated.

“What is happening?” she asked him. “Auntie wants to beat us,” he replied. As she calmed him down, her mind wandered to Priscilla. She had always had a good rapport with her children, and none had ever complained of being mistreated in anyway by her. She had hardly finished the thought when her son said;

 “Mummy, please go and bring Priscilla back, she can live here with her child.”

That simple statement seemed to answer all her problems.

 “I took three days off work and drove all the way to Kambiti. When I got there, I was directed to a coffee plantation where Priscilla was working. The only question she had when I told her that I wanted her to come back home with me was where she was going to take all the coffee she had harvested, to which I replied that I was willing to pay for it. We picked Martha and drove back to Nairobi the same day.”  Veronica and her husband had informed their children of the arrival of their new ‘sister’ and they were all looking forward to meet her, as well as welcoming Priscilla back.

“That day, we were all so excited. I was seven years old, and had a brown teddy bear which I was itching to give her. It was our welcome gift for her, but when Martha saw it, she was so terrified, she started to cry,” Helimah, the couple’s second born daughter, recalls.

Mother and child eased into their new life smoothly, especially because the whole family and their friends accepted Martha without any reservations, including the family doctor, James Ndung’u, who insisted on treating Martha for free whenever she fell ill. To date, Martha gets free treatment at his clinic.

The Kamaus have educated Martha up to university – they even took her to the same primary school as their children.

Says Martha,

“We all went to Lang’ata West Primary School. Susan and Lawrence (the last born twins) were in upper primary at that time, and I remember them being very protective of me, they always looked out for me.”

Just like she saw her older siblings do, Martha would hand the fees structure and anything school-related to George, who she calls dad, and would go to Veronica with any “girl-related” expenses, while her mother would give her pocket money.

“When we took Martha in, we made a decision to raise her like our own, it is the least we could do because Priscilla has always been good to our children, and loved them unconditionally,” says Veronica, whose special name for Martha is Njoki, named after her younger sister, who she is very fond of.

Martha did not attain the pass mark to join a local university, and disappointed, turned to Helimah for advice. Helimah floated the idea of doing A–levels. Her parents agreed, and they immediately began to look for a school in Uganda. Once they got one, George and his wife travelled to Uganda with Martha and ensured that she was settled in before returning home.

“On that trip, there were so many things she was required to buy, we ended up using up all the money we had carried. Luckily, we had paid for the hotel room, but since we could not afford supper, we slept hungry,” George adds, laughing good-naturedly.

“We were all so happy that Martha was going to start this new life in Uganda, it seemed very exciting,” says Helimah.

Martha passed her examinations, and was admitted to Makerere University, where she graduated in 2012 with a Bachelor of Social Sciences with a major in International Relations.

“On her graduation day, the Kamaus were elated, especially because the promise they had made to themselves that she would get the same opportunities as their biological children had come to pass.

Says George,

“I did not want a situation where it would look like we had discriminated her, yet we had taken her under our wing.” Ensuring that Martha got a good education was also a way of rewarding their trusted employee.

“Priscilla is the most trustworthy and loyal house manager I have ever had. We value her, and wanted to give something back in return. We knew that nothing would give her greater joy than seeing her daughter became a successful person able to support herself.” Today, Martha is employed at a real estate company owned by one of her siblings, and is looking forward to her wedding later this year at the Africa Inland Church. Priscilla, who calls Veronica mama, says that she is happy here, and considers the Kamaus her second family.

“They accepted, respected and loved me and my daughter, and in return, I made a promise to do my job whole-heartedly and to love them and their children.”

No doubt, there are those who would want to know the secret to this lasting relationship, in a society where house helps and their employers rarely have a kind word for each other.

Mutual respect, they say.

“We respect each other,” says Veronica, adding that Priscilla is very disciplined and hardworking.

“While they were growing up, I never heard or saw her abusing the children in any way. She was very loving and gave them so much attention, we would be forced to point out that she was neglecting her child,” says George.

When they disagree, like adults who live together are wont to, they talk about it amicably.

“Of course we have disagreements from time to time, but through talking openly, we always come to an agreement.

At the moment, this big happy family is busy preparing for Martha’s wedding, George and Veronica at the fore front, after all, their last born daughter is about to turn the next chapter of her life, and they want to sure that the transition will be a memorable one."
Faith Oneya,"I know this question is bound to attract vitriol, but I will ask it all the same.

How come we go “oooh” and “aaah” at the sight of a father changing his child’s diaper but hardly notice it if it is a mother doing it? Isn’t he, after all, the child’s parent and should therefore do this as part of his natural duty as a care-giver?

There was a story recently in the Daily Nation about a single father of three who hawks in the streets of ***town with his 6-month-old daughter strapped on his chest.

The feedback section in the article was full of gushing comments such as, “He is such a good father,” among others, all praising his “goodness”.

Every day, I see mothers hawking with their children on their backs, others skilfully balancing young tots on one knee while aggressively hawking their wares, even sparing a few minutes to call out to their toddler who has gone too close to cars or administering some tough love.

Where are the accolades for these women? Where are the accolades for the single mothers who tough it out to ensure that their children do not lack? Aren’t they, just like the single fathers, being good parents?

The father that “dares” to “do the woman’s job” of bathing his child will take a selfie with the poor little naked child, post it on Facebook or Instagram and get flooded with 100-plus comments of how “good” a father he is, how “cool”, how “liberal”.

The mother that daily, religiously, bathes her little prince or princess hardly has time for the said selfies (Not with supper waiting to be cooked and served). Nobody thanks her for being “such a good mommy”. It is, after all, a woman’s job.

Why do we have baby-showers for women and not men? It is unheard of, nay, taboo, for a man to be seen or heard at such functions. They might be part of the WhatsApp group that helps plan the “Surprise” baby shower, but his duty will be clearly spelt out. Explicitly. “We know you are the child’s father, but your job is to keep the mother from finding out about the party, and to drop her off at the shower venue. Don’t ruin this!”

Little wonder, then, that everyday parenting tasks, if done by the father, are considered superhuman, but if done by the mother, are considered mundane.

It is not unusual to hear conversations like:

“So and so put the baby to sleep today, he is such a good father. Can you imagine a man soothing a baby to sleep? He is such a good dad.”

I cannot start explaining to you the many levels of ridiculous the above statement is.

Why wouldn’t a father soothe his baby to sleep? Isn’t he one of the first points of contact with his child? Doesn’t his blood flow in the child’s veins? Even if the child is adopted, has he not made the choice to be the father and shouldn’t he therefore behave in a manner to suggest that he is?

I go back to my question: why do we set such low standards for Kenyan fathers?

Granted, men and women are engineered differently. Women are indeed caregivers by nature, but to judge fatherhood by such low standards is as good as ridiculing them.

Hats off to the men and women who parent without glory. Parenting is tough enough as it is, without the shallow judgment that we have subjected men to. "
Faith Oneya,"“Where were you when they got pregnant? You are the authority so make sure you arrest the culprit before they impregnate the young girls,” a tough-talking Rift Valley Regional Commissioner George Natembeya told the chiefs in his jurisdiction in a widely circulated social media clip.

It’s a question that every adult in Kenya needs to ask him or herself in relation to teenage pregnancies: “Where were you when they got pregnant?”  Because the inconvenient truth about teenage pregnancies is that we are all culpable, even if some public figures seem to be working very hard to make us believe that’s not the case.

The recent news that nearly 4,000 girls in Machakos were impregnated in the past five months have elicited two familiar reactions: denial and finger-pointing. None of these two reactions solve anything. The Ministry of Health, while acknowledging that there is a problem, also proclaimed that the numbers reported in Machakos were “exaggerated, outrageous and not a true reflection of the actual statistics”. Exaggerated or not, what’s not in question is that the pandemic has not been with its own trials on the fate of women and girls, as the reports of increased cases of domestic and sexual violence attest to. Notably, there was no accompanying commitment from the ministry on specific actions that would help address the scourge.

Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha blamed it on “the exposure to adult content”, adding that it led school-going children into experimenting with premarital sex.

Not one to be left out of a controversial debate involving morals, the  Kenya Film Classification Board CEO Ezekiel Mutua blamed the surging numbers in Machakos on “vulgar vernacular music”. Among some Kenyans, the common cultural narrative is that teenage pregnancy is a question of morals, so it’s often taken as a referendum on the girl’s character.

The day everybody stops blaming teenage pregnancies on the “loose morals of the girls” is the day we’ll start winning. If anyone has loose morals, then it’s the adults responsible for impregnating the little girls.

Some Kenyans have gone ahead of themselves and poked holes into the numbers provided by the Kenya Health Information System, calling it an attempt by NGOs to “whip up public outrage and create support for the Reproductive Healthcare Bill”.

Among other things, the Bill seeks to provide a framework for the protection and advancement of reproductive health rights for every person.

Anybody who needs “shocking statistics” to recognise that there’s an endemic problem needs to be checked for amnesia, for nothing is new about the staggering numbers.

The point all these blithe explanations and objections miss is that scapegoating the issue only serves to seriously injure attempts to address the problem. Apportioning blame to external forces while not acknowledging our own role is counter-productive.

So, where were you, as Mr Natembeya asked? Perhaps you were busy spreading propaganda on social media about the Reproductive Healthcare Bill. Perhaps you were busy opposing the Comprehensive Sex Education proposal. Perhaps you were embroiled in a bitter argument about why the girls were to blame for being pregnant.

Or maybe you were busy switching off the vulgar music on radios and TVs. And was that you arguing passionately for lowering of the age of sexual consent?

If the answer is ‘yes’ to any of these questions, then you are complicit in crucifying our teenage girls. It’s hard to imagine where the political will to contain the scourge will come from because they’ve had numerous opportunities in the past to do so and failed the teenagers.

 Perhaps the ultimate antidote to the scourge might be for each of us to look in the mirror and ask ourselves what role we can play at an individual level to address the rape culture and gaps in sexual health education."
Faith Oneya,"If the boisterous cries against “bullying and victimisation” in relation to the threats of impeachment against Kirinyaga County Governor Anne Waiguru don’t sound a claxon about hypocrisy in matters gender equality, then little else will.

What has long been served to us in teaspoons by politicians is suddenly being dished out in gallons of empty rhetoric.

In speaking against corruption allegations levelled against Ms Waiguru, ODM’s Junet Mohamed said the party would defend the embattled governor, as she was “being bullied simply because she is a woman” and that “some people out there do not believe that women can lead”. Thank you, mheshimiwa, for gallantly coming to the defence of a damsel in distress. But think about it. Can any political party in Kenya confidently say they believe in women’s leadership unless in reference to tokenism?

Gender inequality in political leadership in Kenya currently stands at 23.5 per cent across government bodies, according to Women Deliver, a global agency that champions gender equality and the health and rights of girls and women. We lag behind our East African counterparts.

Ms Waiguru is one of the three governors elected in 2017, so the need to protect her from harm can be understood. But in this specific context, the concern is not genuine.

If we lived in a country that believed women can lead, then they would not have to shed blood and tears to hold political seats. Boardrooms, too, would not have the pitifully low numbers of female representation. Public Service and Gender Cabinet Secretary Margaret Kobia, in defending the governor, termed the calls for her impeachment a showcase of “how we don’t value strong women leadership”.

She is right, to some extent. Bullying has, for a long time, been synonymous with women vying for elective posts in Kenya.

But even that statement smacks of insincerity.

Because Ms Waiguru is only the latest in a string of female politicians who’ve come under political fire for one allegation or another. Where was the public defence when the backs of the other women were against the wall? Is it that they did not have “strong leadership” or is it that it did not serve any political agenda to support them? The jury’s out on that one.

It’s preposterous to use the gender card only when it’s convenient to do so and not in instances when it’s sorely needed. Hopefully, the flak CS Kobia received from online watchdogs gave her office points of reflection.

On the other hand, the politicians who claim to be the heroes in matters of gender equality had many opportunities to prove this but they did not. The elusive two-thirds gender rule bill, which seeks to bridge the gender disparity in the House by allowing for extra nomination slots for women, has flopped four times, with no record of loud protests from politicians. Kenya Women Parliamentary Association (Kewopa), which should have featured prominently, also seems to be a cosmetic outfit, a mask to be worn only when it’s convenient.

There are many more instances of gender injustices.

It took the intervention of ordinary Kenyans to save the women and children who slept in the cold after the Kariobangi demolitions, not the politicians singing the gender equality song.

And where was the indignation when more than three million schoolgirls went without their supply of sanitary towels in 2019 despite the government allocating Sh420 million for the same?

Unless the message being passed across here is that the plight of a governor facing impeachment is more important than that of a girl who can’t attend school because she is on her monthly period.

Or the girl whose studies have been cut short because she is pregnant. Or Purity Muthoki from Makueni whose husband recently chopped both her hands off. Or primary-school-age boys who were sodomised in Chuka.

Pretending to give a hoot about the gender agenda for political mileage leaves a disgraceful stain on the fight."
Faith Oneya,"The Covid-19 pandemic has been a disorienting experience for everybody but has likely hit our children the hardest, especially those who were waiting to be sacrificed at the altar of the all-consuming Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) and the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) examinations. The pandemic has steadily been unpicking the seams of their tightly woven plans to pass.

In many ways, these national exams are the most rudimentary of measures of learners’ intellectual capabilities. But they’re hallowed in the hierarchy of academic achievements and remain profitable for many cartels.

They should be regarded as one of the safety concerns for learners. A majority of them will suffer their way through them. Some might lose their self-esteem, minds and lives in the process.

There have been mixed reactions from the public about schools reopening, with some sections calling for candidates to be allowed back first and others calling for the postponement of the exams.

Kenya National Union of Teachers (Knut) boss Wilson Sossion said nobody in this country should gamble with the lives of learners and teachers, adding that KCPE and KCSE are not a ticket to heaven. Amen to that. It’s been said over and over again that the war against Covid-19 will be won with proper sanitation. But reports have shown that this is a pipe dream for most schools, which not only lack running water but also don’t have enough toilets for learners.

A World Health Organisation (WHO) report from 2017 revealed that schools pose a great sanitation risk and flagged Kenya as one of the countries lagging behind in this area. 

More than that, the yawning gaps in safety of learners in schools are most likely far more threatening than Covid-19 could ever be.

Termed second homes for our children, experience has proved that they are anything but that because of the danger lurking in the shadows.

A 2019 report by the Kenya Union of Post Primary Education Teachers on school safety revealed most schools in Kenya can’t guarantee the safety of learners. This brings to mind the kindergarten pupil in Mombasa who was killed after falling through a bus floor in 2017. The report also says most schools did not break down safety regulations to enable children to understand and avoid risk. But it’s more than just a knowledge gap question.

The tragic events at Precious Talent school on that bleak Monday, September 23, 2019, illustrate how some schools have become the place where children go to die better than any statistics could.

A recap, for those who may have forgotten, is that their one-storey classroom collapsed, seven lives were lost, and over 60 learners escaped with injuries. A year later, we have simply moved on as we shout about Covid-19 while awaiting the next tragedy because, let’s face it, nothing much has changed since then.

There have been numerous media reports of learners using dilapidated structures not even suitable for goats as classrooms, especially in rural areas. Moreover, school fires have become the norm whenever national exams threaten the sanity of learners. From the Bombolulu Girls School incident in 1998, where 26 girls died, to the Kyanguli Secondary School fire in 2001 that saw 58 students burnt to death, it’s frightening to think that we’ve not seen the worst of it yet.

The Ministry of Education has time and again issued directives on how to tame these school fires, and recommended a raft of other measures to keep children safe in schools in general, but these words remain on the lips of officials and in dusty documents.

A spot check of public schools on any given day will reveal the glaring dangers children are still exposed to. May the ghosts of the learners who lost their lives in schools haunt us until we find permanent solutions to ensure that schools never claim another soul."
Faith Oneya,"“If something happens to your grandmother as a result of what you have done, how will you live with it?” President Uhuru Kenyatta reportedly asked his son, who had flouted the curfew and other measures the government has put in place to curb the spread of Covid-19.

The President was speaking to the Daily Nation about the challenges he was facing as the Head of State and as a father dealing with the disruption caused by the pandemic.

Mama Ngina Kenyatta, who is over 80, forms part of the most vulnerable groups, according to the World Health Organization. Ministry of Health officials have shouted about this too many times for it not to be at the top of our minds.

The President was rightly concerned, as research has established that young people aged 20 to 39 are super spreaders of the virus. It gets even more worrying. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus recently advised that “people aged 60 years or over, or those with underlying conditions, should wear a medical mask in situations where physical distancing is not possible”. On June 8, Health CAS Rashid Aman specified that they should wear N95 masks.

It’s quite disturbing to see that even with the knowledge that the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions are the most vulnerable to the virus, little has been done to protect them.

The government doesn’t seem to know the difference between saying they should be protected and actually doing so. Because there’s very little evidence of the latter.

 If the true measure of a society is in how it treats its weakest members, then Mahatma Gandhi would weep if he saw how Kenya treats the elderly.

Take the N95 mask, for example. The price ranges between Sh200 and Sh1,500, which is beyond the dream of a 60-year-old-plus pensioner struggling with basic expenses. For those supposed to benefit from their pension, the system is rigged to make sure they don’t.

A report by former Auditor-General Edward Ouko indicated that some clever folks at the Treasury orchestrated a money heist that saw the government lose at least Sh67.9 billion in irregular payments by pension schemes to undeserving claimants.

The elderly can’t depend on the much-hyped elderly cash transfer programme either, as it’s marred with corruption. Tales have emerged about unscrupulous Kenyans using national identification cards of the elderly to obtain the funds.

And speaking of disbursement, it would be a great time to make use of the Huduma Namba, which the government promised would “be the ‘single source of truth’ on a person’s identity” and “point for ease of service delivery to the people of Kenya”.

 If there was any truth to the “single source of truth”, then it would have been a fantastic channel to distribute the much-needed N95 masks to the vulnerable. But we seem to have endured long queues for nothing. If only one could take comfort in the idea that the Covid-19 funds, which seem to be trickling in from every corner, would be used to buy the N95 masks. But we can’t.

Past research has shown that aid hardly ever reaches those it’s meant to. If a quick survey was done today about how many ordinary Kenyans have received free masks and sanitisers, they would not be enough to fill a bus.

Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) Chief Executive Officer Twalib Mbarak, commenting about monitoring of the Covid-19 emergency fund, also noted that it is during times of emergencies that money is misused for selfish gain.

The financial burden of purchasing the N95 masks for the elderly will fall on the shoulders of the already strained children and grandchildren.

The only consolation the elderly have is that the WHO have proven to have a history of backtracking on their advice. So this N95 requirement might soon give birth to “that’s not what we meant” from them."
Faith Oneya,"Never let anybody say Kenyans are not a caring lot. Our collective empathy played out on a global scale this past week when we donated the “Haki Yetu” phrase for use in the #BlackLivesMatter demonstrations in the United States, which were sparked by the death of a black man, George Floyd, who was cuffed and asphyxiated by policemen.

Nobody can forget the infamous Alex Ndiritu from Nyeri who exported rage to America when, in replying to a post by CNN about the protests, urged Americans to “burn the White House”. Kenyans joined Mr Ndiritu and the world in speaking out against police brutality and racism. Raila ‘Agwambo’ Odinga also Tweeted a Martin Luther King-inspired message about the same, and the irony of global versus local empathy did not escape anybody.

Beyond the apparent hypocrisies, the show of concern and solidarity was a beautiful example of what “If my brother’s in trouble so am I” looks like. One can only hope the support for #JusticeForGeorgeFloyd yields an everlasting change in race-inspired violence world over.

Like any other “hotbed of terror”, Kenya is no stranger to unlawful killings by policemen.

On June 1, a homeless man in Mathare, known as Vaite to his neighbours, was walking home when a policeman shot him dead. Moments earlier, policemen had shot in the air, ostensibly to disperse the residents and force them to adhere to the 7pm curfew.

Nobody seems to know Vaite’s real name but most Kenyans on social media have seen the graphic images of his body by now. As painful as it is to say it, even his death was not as significant as Mr Floyd’s.

The Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA) reported that in enforcing the curfew, the police have to date killed 15 people and injured 31. Perhaps it’s bullet-proof jackets Kenyans need and not masks.

Vaite is just one of the 16 people shot dead every month by Kenyan police, according to the Deadly Force database run by the Nation Newsplex team.

The project monitors local media, social media and human rights and IPOA reports to track the demographics of each person killed by the police and the circumstances surrounding their deaths.

The number is most likely much higher, according to human rights groups, as 16 only accounts for the reported cases. Given that the unlawful killings are concentrated in the slums and low-income areas, one is tempted to conclude that while racism bites America, classism is what bites us at home.

The question then is: why is there so much apathy about what’s happening locally and so much empathy for events occurring thousands and thousands of kilometres away?

It shouldn’t be surprising, given how pervasive the American culture is in our lives: from the music, language, dressing to TV shows.

If this does not give any insights, then the police spokesman’s responses about police brutality during an interview with NTV certainly do.

Mr Charles Owino said police officers who were accused of brutality were “probably young and drunk from the little power they have”, adding that may have been provoked by errant civilians. Provoked? Maybe President Trump shared his script with him. Or vice versa. You can never tell these days.

If American novelist and activist Lydia Maria Child was alive today, she would tell Mr Owino that the US is a warning rather than an example to the world. Kenyans were rightly outraged by Mr Owino’s sentiments.

But the insights lie in what Mr Owino left unsaid: That the culture of violence from policemen in Kenya is so entrenched and normalised that not even a photo of a bloody body is enough to summon rage that could meet the proportions Mr Floyd’s death inspired. Certainly not enough rage to make the #JusticeforVaite hashtag trend for long, if that’s a valid measure.

The tragedy is that everything will soon be restored to factory settings as we separate ourselves from empathy and work ourselves back to the familiar story of policemen killing and maiming innocent people. What a pity."
Faith Oneya,"Fellow Kenyans, if you want an example of what a donkey’s kicks look like, look no further than the Ministry of Health’s treatment of health workers.

The perpetually eloquent, and lately querulous, Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe has made it one of his priorities to thank health workers, “who have worked tirelessly and sometimes under very difficult conditions”, during his press briefings.

But it seems like the “Thank Yous” are empty, given that his ministry is yet to deliver on its flowery promises almost two months down the line.

The Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union acting Secretary-General, Dr Chibanzi Mwachonda, acknowledged the Covid-19 Emergency Fund efforts in prioritising the procurement of personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare workers during a phone interview with me.

But he wondered why the Ministry of Health was yet to come out with information about their own efforts in distributing PPE.

Fellow Kenyans, this is not to say that the #MoneyHeist fears you had about the Sh48 million spent on airtime, tea and ambulance hire are not valid.

But let’s focus on the plight of health workers for a minute, since the government seems intent on doing the opposite.

Last week, the Daily Nation published a story about a nurse in Meru who was forced to wear improvised PPE made from a plastic garbage bag before he attended to a patient suspected to be suffering from Covid-19. This was dismissed by the authorities as “mere propaganda”, but it remains a tragic reminder of how dire the situation is for health workers: most of them would not be able to buy their own PPE, given the flood of challenges they face, like delayed salaries and poor working conditions.

“Those dealing directly with Covid-19 patients have been sorted out with PPE kits but their counterparts, like those who actually receive the patients in the triage, are not fully equipped yet they are also at risk,” Dr Mwachonda said, adding that he was concerned about the proliferation of locally manufactured substandard PPE kits, which meant their protection was compromised.

If the Ministry of Health had a reputation for answering questions posed to them, this would be a great one to ask, given that there was a whole press conference held at the beginning of April, where Industrialisation and Trade CS Betty Maina announced that the government had started manufacturing protective masks and PPE.

To date, there’s no publicly available information on how many were made or distributed.

This cavalier attitude from the Ministry of Health is not abnormal. It’s perfectly aligned with our culture of impunity, fellow Kenyans.

We bask in its glory; we celebrate “panya routes”, which allow us to break free and travel in places where it’s restricted.

I recently overheard a conversation between two men who said that it costs Sh500 to leave Eastleigh and Sh200 to come back in despite the government ban on movement in and out of the area. They laughed about it, perhaps acknowledging that corruption is so entrenched in Kenyan culture that not even a pandemic can wipe it off.

CS Kagwe’s calls to “behave abnormally” have fallen on deaf ears. From refusing to wear face masks properly to ignoring social distancing requirements, there’s no rule that Kenyans are incapable of breaking.

CS Kagwe should not bother scolding anyone. We are all taking the cues on impunity from his ministry. The government has also been a shining example of how not to social-distance, with all the meetings held to plot political moves that have been held of late.

There might be no solution for the perennial impunity in Kenya but since our hope in winning the war on Covid-19 is banked on health workers, it’s time to reward them all by taking care of their basic personal protection while at work.

An empty thank you, so goes the Swahili proverb, does not fill the pot."
Faith Oneya,"As a child of AMKA forum for Women’s Literature, which Wanjiku Matenjwa co-founded in 1997, I felt a deep sense of loss when I learnt of her death. Our interactions in the last 12 years of my association with the forum had, however, been sporadic until June 2019, when we had the first (and last) hearty conversation.

Before this, she had emailed me about an article I wrote, lauding me for highlighting the plight of the boy child.

“We seem to have heeded the call to empower the boy child as well,” she said.

From our brief interactions at AMKA before, I knew she was not a woman shy of speaking her mind. Little wonder then that she created a space where women could do exactly that by amplifying their voices through writing.

I broke my literary virginity at AMKA, having been one of the featured writers in a 2012 anthology titled Fresh Paint, published by AMKA in collaboration with the Goethe Institut.

The Institut also hosted the monthly AMKA literary forums and on the day I spoke at length to Wanjiku, I had guest-moderated a session where her former students at Kenyatta University, Wangari Mwangi, performed one of the poems she penned  titled, Today I’m Name Dropping, much to Wanjiku’s delight.

“You did my poem justice,” said Wanjiku later. Her smile did not leave her face for the remainder of the sessions.

Here’s a snippet of a few lines from the poem:

What is your name woman? / What-is-your-name!! WOMAN!!/ MADAM MADDAME WHAT-IS-YOUR-NAME? / Today Sir my name is Esther Passaris. /And Fatma Gedi. /YOU-STUPID-WOMAN I ASKED YOU WHAT IS YOUR YOUR NAME!!!!???/ I am sorry sir/Today my name is/D-O-C-T-O-R S-T-E-L-L-A N-Y-A-N-Z-I./ Doctor Stella Nyanzi sir. /Today my name sir is/ DR IVY WANGECHI/These @#$#&^/ women who don't listen to instructions- I asked you Maddame what is your name? /Simple/Oh sorry sir. /Really sorry sir/My name is Alaa Salaah/What is wrong with this woman? /Is your head sitting properly?

In many ways, the poem defined the Wanjiku I ‘met’ that day in June: Defiant, loud, passionate, outspoken, humourous and cheeky with a larger than life personality. The lines offered glimpses of her personality that I had never been privy to and we (Wangari, Wanjiku and I), spent the better part of the afternoon giggling like little girls and talking about literature, music and dancing.

“Do you remember what else we talked about?” I asked Wangari later, but neither of us could. All we remembered was the laughter.

But Wanjiku also expressed some concerns about AMKA. About whether the sanctity of the space — which is meant to nurture women’s writing, was still being maintained. I did not feel equipped to contribute, having been an unfaithful attendee for years, but she then switched to the beginnings, spinning such a spell-binding tale about the origins of the space for women that I told her:

“We need to tell this AMKA story properly. It’s fascinating!”

But I did not keep my word. My procrastination cost me a great story.

MP Yusuf Haji, in a condolence message posted on his Twitter account, remembered Wanjiku as a gallant activist in the struggle for change in Kenya, adding that she comes from a long line of heroines like the late Dr Wanjiru Kihoro and Muthoni Matenjwa. I only learnt of this upon her death, and wished I had known before, so I could prod her for the stories, for she was a gifted narrator.

Later, in reading her eulogy, I discovered we were both alumnae of St Brigid's Girls High School Kiminini, which she attended between 1968 and 1971. We would have had much to talk about.

I may not have kept my word about telling her story, but it remains immortalised in her poetry, in the space for women she founded, in the books she wrote and the ones she edited. Wanjiku passed away on May 15, and was buried on May 22. May she rest in power."
Faith Oneya,"Working from home has become the new normal, thanks to coronavirus.

In keeping with international trends, Kenyan companies have been forced to embrace this new normal whose potential benefits include increased productivity, stronger organisational loyalty, increased morale and job satisfaction, additional flexibility, increased family time, fewer monthly expenses, and fewer sick days taken, according to research conducted by Ajay Garg and Jan van der Rijst, who co-wrote a paper titled “The Benefits and Pitfalls of Employees Working from Home”.

The working-from-home phenomenon has also arrived with big, hairy, unprecedented challenges. Anecdotal evidence suggests that both employers and employees are unprepared to handle them.

One social media user, Bernard Moseti, tells me: “We are working longer hours than usual. Taking up assignments of up to three colleagues at ago. Everything sent on email is now an emergency. The eight-to-five rule is no more. Then the Zoom meetings that take the first 30 minutes of asking whether Person X is joining.”

His words encapsulate the frustrations of most employees who have been “blessed” with the gift of working from home.

Garg and Rijst concur. They note in their study that technologies like email and teleconferencing lack warmth and social presence, getting in the way of working effectively. Zoom, Skype and their hallowed relatives have become the blue-eyed children of working from home.

But even so, they’ve made it that much harder to disconnect from work. One social media user commented that she felt like she was always working because of this constant connectivity.

Research has also shown that continual meetings via these platforms are likely to cause burnout, fogginess and alienation, according to an article in the New York Times.

Technology also exacerbates working-from-home challenges for women. A study I conducted in 2019, ""Opportunities Digital Technologies Present for Women in Media"", concluded that flexibility, which has often been viewed as a great benefit of technology, is both a blessing and a curse for working women.

While the blessings are obvious, the curses come packaged in the socially accepted and expected roles of the woman in the house as the primary caregiver of her children and husband, cook, home-teacher, and other stereotypical duties in addition to her work duties.

In her book Women and Journalism, Suzanne Franks referred to it as being in an electronic cage as opposed to an electronic cottage. A female Facebook user pointed out that between homeschooling, housekeeping, working remotely and a one-week virtual office retreat they were undergoing, she felt like she was going to drop dead from fatigue.

With the current state of affairs, men seem to be right inside the cage with women.

Employers are facing the prospects of injured profits and a host of other business challenges, and this might explain the overzealousness and radioactive speed with which they are summoning employees for virtual meetings, among other extra demands on their time.

The impression one gets sometimes is that employers believe their employees have an extra eight hours to their days.

And employees, cognisant of looming layoffs, pay cuts and unpaid leave (if they have not happened already), are dancing to the tune of the employers, often leaving little time or room to experience the benefits of working from home that were mentioned earlier in this article.

It’s quite disturbing to think that the post-pandemic employee might be a jaded, burnt-out version of himself or herself, if the challenges are not contained.

For employers, it would work in their favour to regard the physical and mental well-being of their employees as highly as they do Zoom meetings, and to trust that their employees are doing all they can at home to be worthy of employment because they simply can’t afford not to."
Faith Oneya,"I have a very soft spot for Kenyan authors so my joy was unbridled when I picked up a copy of Who Will Catch Us as We Fall by Canada-based Kenyan author Iman Verjee.

But my heart sunk a little bit in disappointment when I read the line “Kuwakaribisha Nairobi” (Welcome to Nairobi) in the first page of the first chapter of the book. To put this in context, Leena, one of the main characters in the book, was arriving home in a Kenya Airways Boeing 747 from the United Kingdom and these words allegedly came from the flight attendant.

Not quite a warm welcome, I concluded, seeing that the syntax of the Kiswahili sentence was completely off, and even the most basic speaker of the language would catch that. But this was the first warning sign that there were some levels of disconnect by the author, which she admits in the acknowledgement section when she says:

“When I first began writing this novel, I knew exactly why I was writing it but I was too ashamed to say the reason out loud. The truth is, I felt disconnected from a place I was meant to call home. Yet its smells, colors and noises thrilled me.”

Who Will Catch Us as We Fall traces the lives of three characters –Leena and her brother Jai and Michael, the son of their house help. The author uses racial and tribal stereotypes to bring out the tensions in Kenya and exposes the underbelly of corruption and greed among citizens and policemen.

At first glance, the book seems to focus on pointing a huge, accusatory finger at Kenyan populace but a deeper look reveals the racial tensions, desperation and rebellions that simmer underneath each character and scene.

One of the redeeming qualities in the book lies in the author’s expert use of imagery. Describing a scene where a police officer was salivating over a possible bribe, she writes:

“He saw only her, perfectly polished, like a smoothed down piece of valuable soapstone.”

And of Michael, she says is was as if he “considered each word a thousand times before stringing them together-a perfectly constructed necklace of thought.”

Nairobi’s dirty linen is literally aired in public in Who Will Catch Us as We Fall. The author aptly and artfully describes the sounds, smells, sights and tastes of the city. Nothing is left to chance. You will meet traffic jam and traffic policemen eager to collect bribes from hapless motorists. You will meet street urchins who are unafraid to threaten motorists with urine if they don’t yield to their demands for money. You will meet University of Nairobi student leaders in the middle of protests, among other typically Nairobi scenes. And what’s Nairobi without the pitiful scenes in Kibera where poverty reigns supreme?

Whatever the book lacks in proper Kiswahili phrases, it makes up for in the vivid descriptions of the city.

The affair between Leena and Michael is reminiscent of “My Bukusu Darling”, a love story that grabbed the attention of the Kenyan nation in 2014 when an Asian woman defied her parents and strict traditions because her love for a poor Bukusu man, even moving into his home in Webuye. The tension between Leena and Michael carries on throughout the book and represents the tension of the nation as well from the nineties through to 2007 in the time of post-election violence.

Who Will Catch Us as We Fall is a no frills book that is as much a love tale as it is a political story.

"
Faith Oneya,"Faced with the daunting reality of empty accounts post-Covid-19, private schools have been forced to take control of their financial fate by reinventing their income streams at the expense of parents and learners. 

With all the attention focused on the war against Covid-19, most schools have taken the opportunity to make outrageous demands in terms of school fees, safe in the knowledge that their actions might barely be noticed.

To be fair, the pandemic has forced some hard choices on schools, which were first to be closed on March 15 as they are considered high-risk areas because of the many learners they hold, and who come from different backgrounds.

The Daily Nation recently carried a story showing how fancy schools are struggling to stay afloat. Nevertheless, this doesn’t negate the fact that some of the decisions taken by schools — like rushing to charge them astronomical amounts for virtual learning — have harmed parents.

When Brookhouse School demanded a 90 per cent school fees payment from parents for online learning, they fought back by suing the school and the court compelled the institution to reduce the fees by half. Kudos to the parents.

While one can’t extrapolate too much on the case of the Brookhouse School parents, given that they are not a towering example of the average Kenyan parent, it’s still a valid example of the frustrations most parents are feeling with their children’s schools. The proponents of the Competency-Based Curriculum, to which a majority of schools in Kenya subscribe, boast about the level of involvement from a parent that’s needed for the learner to succeed but the top-down approach to imposing supplementary virtual learning classes on parents is the antithesis of this.

Most parents will testify that nobody asked them what they needed and what would work for their children, schedules or homes.

The notion of synchronous virtual learning, which most schools have suggested to or imposed on parents, is as utopian as it is unreasonable, given the limited computer access in homes as well as spotty WiFi, among other obstacles like the expenses involved and the crazy work schedules that parents who work in essential services have been forced to adapt to because of the pandemic.

Kenya National Union of Teachers Secretary-General Wilson Sossion has pointed out that the practicability of virtual lessons is far from being a reality in Kenya, adding that supervision in a manner that’s useful to the students is also an issue.

Despite much hype by the government and private schools about virtual learning, one of the things they fail to acknowledge is that it will leave out a significant proportion of learners. It will be survival for the wealthiest, not the fittest.

Data from the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) revealed that the digital divide in Kenya is still a reality, as only one in five Kenyans have access to the internet. The income of the parents also determines whether their children will access virtual lessons or not.

The National ICT Survey Report (2018) by the Communication Authority and the KNBS indicated that employment and household size in many cases determine the household disposable income, which in turn determines whether individuals in households can afford radios, TVs, computers, internet and other ICT equipment.

What’s clear is that by offering blanket solutions for virtual learning, private schools are just combing a dry riverbed.

There is an opportunity here to respond to the abnormal times abnormally, to paraphrase Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe’s now-famous quote about Covid-19.

In their quest to keep afloat, private schools should not forget to fully involve parents in designing solutions that will accommodate different learner’s and parents’ needs.

Nobody will walk away from this pandemic unscathed, but as everything comes unglued after this, private schools can help lessen the impact by doing right by parents and learners."
Bitange Ndemo,"Hillary Clinton once said that women are the largest untapped reservoir of talent in the world. This reservoir can be tapped if we address issues of mentorship and equality.
Studies, notably by the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI), have established that $12 trillion could be added to global GDP by 2025 simply by advancing women’s equality. In an article, How advancing women’s equality can add $12 trillion to global growth, MGI argues that, if this is to happen, the public, private, and social sectors will need to act to close gender gaps in work and society.

And that is not all. The report further argues that:

In a “full potential” scenario in which women play an identical role in labor markets to that of men, as much as $28 trillion, or 26 per cent, could be added to global annual GDP by 2025. Full-potential estimate, according to MGI, is about double the average estimate of other recent studies, reflecting the fact that MGI has taken a more comprehensive view of gender inequality in work.

The potential for women playing a key role in the economy is however not exploited. Women need to be educated, mentored and to independently develop networks for them to succeed.

Some organisations such as the African Women in Technology (AWIT) are leveraging technology to provide access to mentoring, networking and learning. The existence of stereotypes in society, especially in Africa, is so strong that dealing with it effectively, there is no other option but to provide opportunities and a safe space to develop and grow women leaders in both tech and society.

The scenarios are changing, albeit slowly. Locally, a young entrepreneur, Topyster Muga, founded the myProsper.app startup, an App that will assist young professionals to succeed in their endeavors. With experienced, highly accomplished professionals offering personalised, trustworthy affordable advice on demand online and over the phone, the startup provides career and business mentorship on a freelance basis, taking advantage of the digital world that enables meetings in a variety of platforms.

myProsper.app recognise that while most people desire a thriving social life, a healthy and fit body, emotional intelligence and of course a better financial status, they are often at a loss on how to follow through. The focus of this start up is to provide the bridge between one’s desires and the outcome in life.

They deal with critical developmental skills such as personal productivity, resilience and finances. Younger mentees are taken through life experiences, and their digital presence (understanding the online content within their control, such as own website and social media profiles, and other content not within their control, such as online reviews) is appreciated, particularly how it can impact their lives. The application’s dynamic programmes draw on global best practices to design a personalised tech-savvy self-improvement programme that helps the youth grow into their best. They are also exploring Artificial Intelligence for adaptive learning so as to leave no one behind.

These private sector initiatives require policy support, as this would demonstrate that Africa recognises the potential in its women. The African continent is replete with women agenda, frameworks and policies but it’s all talk. Only a handful of countries that have seriously implemented policies on women equality have natured the talent that delivered outstanding outcomes such as that of the founder of this new platform.

This is happening in spite of the fact that African Heads of State like to peddle the hopes of Agenda 2063 “the Africa we want” adopted in 2015, as a framework to drive the Continent’s transformation. In the Agenda, the promise of “a prosperous Africa based on inclusive growth and sustainable development,” with well-educated citizenry is well articulated.

Education is a key cog in the attainment of equality. African governments in 2016 adopted the Continental Education Strategy for Africa 2016-2025 as the framework for transforming education and training in the continent in line with the Global Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG4) of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda.

While there are many frameworks and policies at continental level on equality, especially on access to education, the number of children out of school is staggering. Unesco’s Institute for Statistics (UIS) published a report, 263 Million Children and Youth Are Out of School, in 2016, which stated that more than a quarter a billion children and youth (majority girls) were out of school and that the majority of them were in sub-Saharan Africa.

In countries like Zambia where policies have worked, it was because of intense advocacy on “promoting girls’ education as a human right” by the Forum for African Women Educationalists (FAWE). As a result, “the government rolled out the re-entry policy for teenage mothers in 1997. It required all schools to grant girls maternity leave and readmit them to facilitate their education.”

Tanzanian President John Magufuli issued edicts to ban pregnant students and entrenched his comments into official government policy. The President further castigated nongovernmental organisations that have been advocating allowing teen mothers back in school. He accused advocacy groups as “being used by foreign agents.”

Such retrogressive policy pronouncements that contradict continental aspirations call for the support of women organisations involved in educating and empowering women. "
Bitange Ndemo,"The diffusion of blockchain is intensifying globally. This was evident last week during the virtual launch of a report titled ‘Blockchain for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and Entrepreneurs in Italy’ by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).

Speakers at the launch acknowledged the growing need to enhance transparency, safety, traceability and efficiency as important to national competitiveness of the country’s large, diversified and export oriented industrial base. They emphasised that Italy is well positioned to leverage the potential of distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) for her competitiveness.

The potential of blockchain for SMEs lies in four areas: access to finance such as syndicated loans; financing through tokenisation and crypto assets; trade facilitation especially in trade financing; logistics and shipping as well as custom processes.

Other areas are global supply chain management focusing on the visibility of the supply chain and verification of authenticity; and innovation in business models as the adoption of industry 4.0 starts particularly of the technologies that will drive it such as Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence as well as advanced manufacturing.

With the technology, the country hopes to strengthen the competitiveness of Made in Italy. The country is among the top three economies impacted by counterfeiting and piracy activities after the US and France.

The report notes that industries, which are characterised by a large population of SMEs in Italy, are particularly affected most, with estimated losses of 3.75 billion euros. Overall losses to counterfeits amount to an estimated 24 billion euros, or 3.2 percent of the total sales in 2016. Blockchain is to play a key role in dealing with the menace.

Authors of the report noted that blockchain solutions demonstrate strong potential of serving sectors of the Italian economy that are dominated by SMEs. One of its potential is in value chains, where it can guarantee provenance, transportation, handling, storage and in general supply chain management, agri-food “from farm to fork” process as well as the advanced industries leveraging additive manufacturing/3D printing.

They, however, recognise that there are important policy challenges to be addressed in order to fully take advantage of this technological transition, specifically in relation to the uptake of digital technologies by SMEs.

It was noted that the evolution of the regulatory framework at Italian and European Union levels is fundamental to further development of the technologies. Some of the key regulatory areas include: the complex regulation pertaining the use of DLTs and the lack of a clear picture on the possible public financing opportunities, and the lack of the full legal recognition of smart contracts, which limit companies from unleashing their innovation potential.

The other regulatory concern was the difficult procedure for the management and storage of hash codes in distributed public and private ledgers in compliance with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which hinders innovation. Practitioners participating at the launch called for the creation of legal sandboxes to deal with many of these regulatory challenges.

There are many lessons to learn from Italy’s bold move to embrace this emerging technology for national competitiveness and the development of their SMEs. Italians are not sitting and waiting that change and progress will come like magic. Like good entrepreneurs, they are leading the pack to create new solutions while dealing with some of their problems like counterfeits.

Italians are closely following the footsteps of Israel to become one of the leading economies in the Industry 4.0 technologies. It is not too difficult for a developing country like Kenya to join the league of nations leading the way for the adoption of emerging technologies. However, that will not happen if the regulatory environment is not supportive. "
Bitange Ndemo,"A number of global news organisations opined that a new wave of Covid-19 is in the offing especially in the northern hemisphere as the region approaches winter. If this becomes a reality, then the future of the hospitality industry may be in jeopardy.

Experts have been predicting economic recovery to pre-Covid-19 levels by 2023 but this may not be the case if a vaccine is not found in the first half of 2021. There are many reasons why this scenario is possible.

Besides the inconveniences of quarantines imposed by different countries, there are many other reasons that could delay a normalised travel industry.  These include intensification of digitalisation, climate change issues and the resurgence of nationalism in Western countries.

Conferencing that once was the leading contributor to tourism has gone digital. The digital conferencing platforms are getting better by the day. People are getting used to the conveniences the webinars bring. At the personal level, it has become highly productive when one is able to attend up to three different meetings without losing time in traffic jams or travel to other countries.

Virtually all museums are digitised. People can tour far flung museums without moving out of their homes with chat bots responding to different questions. Animal parks too are being digitised and once that is perfected, we shall be off to developing new revenue models different from the current systems in place.

Digitalisation does not all translate to doom and gloom. Prior to Covid-19, the World Economic Forum had estimated that between 2016 and 2025, digitalisation in aviation, travel and tourism could create up to “$305 billion of value to the industry in profitability.” It was also envisaged that digitalisation will take away “$100 billion of value from traditional players to new competitors and generate benefits valued at US$700 billion for customers and the wider society.” Either way, there was going to be a disruption with both winners and losers. In essence, you’ve got to know where the beef is or else you end up in the dustbin of losers. The beef may well be at your fingertips.

Climate change is also increasingly seeking attention.  It will certainly affect the hospitality sector one way or another. It is estimated that last year fires in Australia cost the tourism industry at least $4.5 billion. Similarly, the California fire damage was estimated to be in excess of $25.4 billion. Wine tourism was affected most. This year also the fires are said to be setting a new record as they take a huge toll on human lives and property. The hospitality industry will suffer the most as people may not travel to California or from the state to other global destinations.

Floods are also causing untold damage to tourism across the world. As a result of climate change, sea levels are rising and threatening to eliminate some of the most beautiful sites like the Maldives Islands.

The current pandemic has shown that we can live in a cleaner environment if there were less pollution in cities and air space. It may not surprise if the world comes together to impose stricter environmental guidelines to make tourism completely climate-dependent.

Lastly, the rise of nationalism in Europe and the US could take the world back many years. The US, for example, is increasingly embracing a narrow ideology of nationalism and isolationism. The rest of the world could ignore this as purely an American affair but it will not be that easy given American status as an economic and military power. The country is also a hodgepodge of nationalities from virtually every part of the world, which means that different segments of American people are linked to other people in other countries by kinship, economic, religious and nationalistic ties.

Almost half, if not more of the US, still believes in the country’s post World War II internationalism that brought much wealth and respect that they may opt to fight for their faith in globalisation. The current politics is unlike the past when the opposing parties had almost similar ideological persuasion. There is, however, a problem with nationalism. In its mobilisation strategies, nationalists unfortunately tend to associate themselves with racism, ethnic supremacy and militarism as it happened in pre-Second World War era. The last time the world witnessed this narrow-mindedness was during the rise of fascism and communism in Europe. It was ugly then and there is no reason to think that it will be different this time round. If you doubt, you just have to watch what happened in Louisville where heavily armed far right and left militia groups faced off.

Unless something is done to tone down the rhetoric, the social media propaganda and the intensification of partisan main stream media, there is a likelihood of witnessing a violent electoral process. It doesn’t matter who wins because each side already sees things differently while some are being incited by different forms of media.  If the worse comes to worst in this time of crisis, it will spark  another global disruption. Any such disruption could cause a global recession.

Unlike in the past when electoral losers accepted defeat graciously, in recent times both the Republicans and the Democrats have urged their candidates not to accept defeat. This will lead to unnecessary division of the world and could limit movement of people. The end result is that a stalemate could severely affect an already battered hospitality industry.

While digitalisation was going to disrupt the hospitality industry, climate change and rise in nationalism could derail the world from recovering from the pandemic. The sector could be in trouble beyond 2023 when expert had predicted full recovery."
Bitange Ndemo,"Covid-19 threatened to separate humanity but cloud-based technologies have brought us closer than at any other time before in our lives. The cloud technology is uniting Africa too.

This unity was demonstrated last week at the virtual launch of Lizz Ntonjira’s new book, #YOUTHCAN. More than one thousand people from 18 African countries joined the event through Zoom, YouTube and Facebook.

Ms Ntonjira, a former business reporter with NTV, engaged with a mostly youth panel, including Nigerian Eno Essien, the CEO of Rheytrak; South African Busisiwe Mahlangu, the author of Surviving Loss and a social activist; South Sudanese Nhial Deng, the head of the Refugee Peace Ambassadors; and Ugandan Nataliey Bitature, the co-founder of Musana Carts. The author represented Kenya.

The topics of discussion were generated from the book’s 50 stories told from 22 African countries narrated by 29 women and 21 men. The countries represented were Angola, Burundi, Cape Verde, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Guinea Conakry, The Gambia, Kenya, Liberia, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

Each chapter generated issues relating to what African Union (AU) policies should do to either create jobs or an enabling environment for wealth creation. The book, which largely focuses on the future, has topics ranging from service to the people, innovating for the future, entrepreneurship, media & arts, sports, research & development as well as going green.

There are 12 chapters, each focusing on sectors that will impact people’s livelihoods in the days to come. Each chapter starts with a thought leader/expert in the respective sector writing an inspiring letter to the younger generation followed by three features of outstanding youth chronicles from various countries in Africa.

The objective of this anthology was to inspire the youth through the lens and stories of other youth in the front line advocating change and making things happens. It is also a great resource for the older generation — particularly in the private, public and development sectors that often have a negatively skewed perception of the youth — to experience that all is not lost for the African youth.

The writers brought together by Ms Ntonjira have never met physically. They all met on social media and agreed to contribute ideas that will have an impact in Africa. The outcome of their virtual engagements has powerfully demonstrated that youth when empowered, indeed can contribute to all sectors of the economy with a passionate desire to be catalysts for both individual and national development.

This technology-assisted youth engagement follows recent highly successful four-part webinar series on transforming agriculture in Africa through digitalisation by the African Development Bank and the Food and Agricultural Organization. With more than 500 participants, the webinar series reached more people at a more intimate engagement than any other form of conference could achieve.

In the era of social distancing, new tools that facilitate virtual connections are emerging and will bring especially the continent of Africa closer than the initiators of pan-Africanism ever imagined. I have watched youth on Discord (a digital distribution platform designed for creating communities ranging from gamers to education and businesses) chatting with peers in different countries and developing comradeship as though they were just in the neighbourhood.

With Netflix Party (a Google Chrome extension) families join friends in far-flung areas to watch television shows and make comments as though they were in the same room. This concept of watching party is a streaming trend started to deal with the social distancing initiative to defeat coronavirus but is taking a life of its own with so many other platforms adopting the technology.

In my view, we now have the what we can effectively use to unite the people of Africa."
Bitange Ndemo,"Gikomba market in Nairobi is the epitome of entrepreneurial informality. Here, very few businesses are registered, pay taxes or have a trading license.

It is famous as the largest source market for used clothing, the so-called mitumba. But the range of available second-hand items goes beyond clothing to all manner of goods.  It is a hodgepodge of every manner of enterprise, covering virtually every sector and organised in several clusters.

Although our visit there last Monday with Anne Mutahi, the presidential advisor on SMEs and her team was to understand the fish supply chain, our attention was diverted to discussing other issues.

Samson Wanjohi, the chairman of the Quarry Market Association was eager to show us the progress made in the new facility built for those who lost property to the recent fires. 
The tour around the imposing modern facility was a blessing since it took us around several clusters. It has textile manufacturers, shoe dealers, and fishmongers, to mention but a few. Then there are the used clothing dealers and their streams of customers. To say that Gikomba was busy is to understate things. If it were not for masking, no one would tell there is a pandemic in this part of world. Traders and customers appeared to be more concerned about their economic survival than their health.

The stark reality of thousands of people interacting in close proximity momentarily distracted my mind and I found myself starting to ask myself questions like: Are there studies we are not doing to enrich the search for Covid-19 therapies? Why has Covid-19 been so lenient to poorer countries? Should Gikomba act as a laboratory to the re-opening of schools?

Many of the traders work literary on what used to be a dumpsite, with water still stagnant and posing the risk of cholera. God is perhaps on their side owing to their humility. Rarely does anyone complain for lack of space as they gingerly walk in crowded paths. They share ideas and help one another to replicate a new idea. It is a philosophy that is more than the concept of open innovation (“the use of purposive inflows and outflows of knowledge to accelerate internal innovation, and expand the markets for external use of innovation, respectively”).

The practice of replication is evident everywhere. The style of the newly manufactured masks is the same and only differentiated by colour. The children’s clothing tailored here are similar and so are the shoes as well as everything else. Susan, in her mid-30s, tells me that their competitiveness is not dictated by the sales they make within the market but the wider social networks they have created.

The entrepreneurial activities in the market are no longer a one-man show as it used to be. Many have progressed and now have employees working for them. The problem is that many of these employees have neither social protection nor job security. With better policies, the situation could change to guarantee a better future for everyone.

Anne is optimistic that change will eventually come. She tells me that we should never rush with policies like stopping the importation of used clothing abruptly. Instead, with the participation of stakeholders, we must have a transitional strategy to move the players here into a formidable local textile industry involving the entire supply chain. The import landscape is changing slowly into inputs for local production. If the fashion industry embraces the emerging development, you will quickly develop a vibrant textile industry.
In the midst of a chaotic environment with frequent fires from unknown arsonists, the building that the national government is hoping to resettle those who have suffered the fire tragedy is almost done. The Quarry Market Association members are hopeful that their leadership will navigate through political, social and economic interests that often delay projects meant for the poor.

Mr Wanjohi and his vice chairman Paul Oimba, also the chairman of the fish traders, are both archetypal leaders that Kenya misses today. They manage people of all political persuasions, with different social and economic backgrounds without fear or favour to maintain calm in a seemingly chaotic environment. Without them, Anne’s work would be a nightmare and she acknowledges that.

Leadership is critical. Neighbouring Kariokor has had a fully equipped government supported shoe factory but has never produced a single shoe. Reason: city politicians want credit where they never sowed any seed. They want a story to tell when the election comes that they built the place and because so and so did not like it, it has never been operational. Poverty is a great asset for politicians and to fight it, there must be strong leadership from the grassroots. Studies show that entrepreneurial informality undermines scalability of enterprises. It is often a direct consequence of failed leadership that is driven by selfish motives on political, social and economic environments.  Informality, therefore, is not a curse or culture as is often assumed. Digitisation of the supply chains for example could quickly formalise informality. This could benefit the employees, the government and the investors.

As stated earlier, the purpose of our visit was basically to understand the problems encountered by fish dealers. Their major concern was safety and quality since fish has become one of the most internationally traded food commodities. In Kenya, we consume close to 1 million tons a year with some of the supplies coming from as far away as China.

To enhance safety, they need cold storage from source to their destination in Nairobi. They also wanted predictable supplies in order to engage in pre-selling to customers. In summary, they wanted improvement in the fish supply chain to ensure predictability in their trade.

Their requirements went beyond the provision of cold storage in the new facility that is just about to be completed.

In Gikomba, there is great hope that the famous market will emerge from the ravages of neglect to offer hope for everyone if the government sustains interventions that it is currently implementing. With emerging technologies, the many informal enterprises in Gikomba could one day be formalised. "
Bitange Ndemo,"That Kenya Power is haemorrhaging is no secret. Since January this year, every headline in the local newspapers about the company has tended to present a different expressive word of a slowly collapsing giant.

Its failure will certainly undermine the country’s competitiveness.

As a result, industrialists are quietly relocating to neighbouring countries and exporting their products into Kenya under regional trade agreements, a large chunk of which tend to favour importation. Manufacturing, one of the key Agenda 4 items that was supposed to increase to 15 percent by 2022 (currently at 9.2 percent), create jobs, increase foreign direct investment and improve ease of doing business, is now on the wrong trajectory.

The Business Daily of August 24 attributes Kenya Power’s fast-declining fortunes to electricity theft facilitated by its own employees as well as their legacy infrastructure. Instead of sealing the loopholes to effectively deal with problem and bring the company back to profitability, Kenyans are being forced to pay more to this giant monopoly. Yet, energy is a key consideration for investors coming to the country.

A recent World Economic Forum (WEF) report, Energy as a Competitive Advantage, says the level of investment in energy infrastructure, as well as the comprehensiveness and efficiency of energy policy, also contribute significantly to a nation’s competitiveness.

Indeed, the Kenya National Energy Policy states “the overall objective of the energy policy is to ensure affordable, competitive, sustainable and reliable supply of energy to meet national and county development needs at least cost, while protecting and conserving the environment.”

With such a clear policy statement, one would think that the energy sector, especially the Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority (Epra), would protect consumers from paying for inefficiency. Instead, Epra allowed Kenya Power to punish consumers with additional charges resulting from theft, corruption and general failures.

The best course of action for a regulator is to compel the company to deal with its problems and encourage innovation to create a more competitive environment.

Monopolies generally tend to be inefficient since they fix prices without fear that someone will bring a substitute product. It is through either policy or regulatory mechanisms that then become efficient.

By now Epra should be encouraging new innovative projects aimed at solving the energy problem as well as waking up Kenya Power to the emerging realities that customers can do without them.

The WEF report noted that technological advances that lower energy costs or increase efficiency are continuously expanding reserves, not only for green investment policy but especially in hydrocarbons such as natural gas fracking.

As we seek alternative energy sources, Kenya Power must make investments in technology (smart grid systems) to curb electricity theft. It has invested in an extensive fibre optic infrastructure over the power lines. This infrastructure is key to developing a smart grid (installing smart meters) as well as a source of new revenue if properly used to supplement fibre to homes.

The meters will be fitted with devices to enable machine-to-machine communication over either wired or wireless channels. The technology will lower operational costs while at the same time monitor production, consumption and distribution of electricity to detect theft when and where it occurs.

Some countries that invested in smart grids have seen the growth of micro grids (decentralised approach to electricity sources) managed by communities that over time have managed to reduce blackouts.

With abundant solar energy in Kenya, we should be decentralising energy and empowering communities to innovate for energy resilience.

Electricity is crucial to the country’s competitiveness that must be dealt with urgently in order to meet the goal of affordability at “least cost” as the energy policy states. "
Bitange Ndemo,"As Covid-19 crept into our lives at the beginning of 2020, I thought to myself that it was one of those corona viruses that would be largely confined to Asia. By March, it became obvious that it would spread across the world. A sense of anxiety, fear and hopelessness began to consume my thoughts.

I started reading as many articles as possible to understand its immunology (study of how the body fights incoming enemies like a virus) and what epidemiologists (professionals who investigate patterns and causes of diseases) and virologists (professionals who study the identification and characterisation of viruses that cause disease) were saying in order to understand the risk the novel virus (not previously recorded) posed to our lives.

Many of the journal articles shared by friends abroad were mostly by virologists and epidemiologists. Immunologists were nowhere. Their absence opened room for propaganda to take effect. Terminologies like “asymptomatic carriers” emerged only to fuel more fear. What scared me most was the fact that every new research publication I read contradicted previous ones. Media amplified what was going on in Italy, Spain, the UK then the US with warning that next will be a catastrophic entry of the disease into Africa. Powerful nations were reduced into hopelessness and the politicians no longer had anything to promise their followers other than preaching hygiene, masking, social distancing and imposing curfews.

Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe, whom I know as a brave man, changed tune to require the infected to stay at home and manage the crisis there. Then one afternoon he invoked Rodney Neely’s quote, “Every man to himself and God for us all,” meaning that everyone finds his own interests and God decides the outcome.

At that moment my anxiety was a notch higher. I needed to make serious decisions – to buy every therapy that I had read about in the research papers, in the media and every other concoction – in the process buying Hydroxychloroquine, Zithromax, Zinc, vitamin D tablets, Effervescent vitamin C tablets (quick absorption), Moringa powder, Cinnamon powder, Ginger, Lemon and Garlic.

Although my response strategy was not to be questioned and that everybody under the roof would have to take my prescriptions prophylactically, I had forgotten that I lived with a medic. She put her foot down that no one is to take non-prescribed medication. I argued that everything I bought was either off-the shelve or from mama mboga. She hid my priced Hydroxychloroquine from me.

Quietly, I found a new dose and other tablets including Vitamin C and D. This was in addition to honey, Lemon, Ginger, Garlic and Cinnamon, which she didn’t consider as dangerous. When she discovered that I had been taking other things not on the public menu, she hit the roof and demanded that I do a liver function test. I obliged.

“Did you start drinking?”the doctor asked me as he went through the results. “Drinking what?” I responded. He suspected I had started drinking alcohol because my liver wasn’t functioning well. He warned that if I continued with whatever I was taking, I will soon have jaundice. “See Daktari, whatever I was doing, I was doing it for good intentions,” I explained.

“Yes, but good intentions can kill,” he concluded as I gave him the list of the medication I had self-prescribed to fight the pandemic.

He was quiet for a moment. Then he said to me, “You are lucky. Do you know that some people have had cardiac arrest from this drug? You could even develop a mental disease. Please listen to your wife.”

I swallowed my pride in stride. This, however, didn’t stop me from other curiosities I harboured such as nutrition and other traditional therapies (motivated by IBM’s non-pharmaceutical interventions). In the absence of any reasonable therapy, I had suspected that nutrition could perhaps provide an answer. I had been curious about the fact that those dying in developing countries are those living in urban areas. Indeed, those people who ran into rural areas are doing great. New studies now show that diet greatly contributes to quick recovery of those suffering from Covid-19.

A recent study, The impact of nutrition on Covid-19 susceptibility and long-term consequences, by a team of researchers from Ohio State University concluded that:

The high rate of consumption of diets high in saturated fats, sugars, and refined carbohydrates (collectively called Western diet, WD) worldwide, contribute to the prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes, and could place these populations at an increased risk for severe COVID-19 pathology and mortality. WD consumption activates the innate immune system and impairs adaptive immunity, leading to chronic inflammation and impaired host defense against viruses.

These findings perhaps explain why the majority of those who have lost their lives live in mostly Western countries where it has severely attacked mostly the elderly, underrepresented minorities, and those with underlying medical conditions. That pattern is beginning to emerge in developing countries similar characteristics suffering the most.

Although in Africa we are poor, there is one thing we do better than people in any other continent – per capita consumption of vegetables. Our rating on this score is high and as such we inadvertently wad off many non-communicable diseases. Several other researches show that such a diet is an overlooked treatment that can fast track your recovery, but the good news is that it's something that's completely in your control. 
Olivia Tarantino in an interview with Cordialis Msora-Kasago (Los Angeles-based national spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics) for Healthy Eating noted in her May 2020 article, This One Mistake Will Slow Down Your Covid-19 Recovery, that, “diet plays a role in your susceptibility to Covid-19, your recovery, and the lasting impact the virus can have on your health.”

As we deal with fear and anxiety over what may happen, the silver lining in this pandemic is the fact that social distancing, masking and better hygiene practices have helped slow down even the common cold. These lessons should inform what our cultural practices should be going forwards. And above all, avoid self-prescription no matter what threats we are facing. Even good intentions could be fatal. It is a lesson for all to learn from."
Bitange Ndemo,"Last week, the British High Commissioner to Kenya, Jane Marriott, inaugurated an Innovation and Research Challenge Board in Nairobi.

The 10-member Board with expertise in Science, Technology and Innovation has been set up to advise the British High Commission’s work in Science, Technology and Innovation.

The purpose of this Challenge Board is to support the British government in Kenya to be innovative and ambitious, to test and validate strategies that will work best for the Kenyan ecosystem.

Already, the British Government has set up UK-Kenya Tech Hub and appointed an experienced lawyer, Sheena Raikundalia, to be the its first director.

The Hub has been in operation since last year with the aim of working with the local tech ecosystem, build talent and linkages within Kenya and the UK.

The focus of the UK-Kenya Tech Hub covers emerging technologies, technology as an enabler to reach the excluded and operational tech to help MSMEs/SMEs use technology to grow.

A release after the launch said that Science, Innovation and Technology underpins the UK’s strategic partnership with Kenya, bringing connections that make both countries flourish.

The research and innovation initiatives come at a time there is a renewed interest in streamlining supply chains for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and linking some to global value chains. Tech has disrupted the MSMEs sector and created more value out of especially the many informal enterprises.

Major progress has been made with several startups in agritech but there is still some work to be done. Farmers are still unproductive; middlemen exploit them and there is a lot of waste amid food insecurity.

In the 1960s when we faced similar challenges, the Government introduced sessional paper No. 10 of 1965 that created the Kenya Industrial Research and Development Institute (Kirdi) and Kenya Industrial Estates (KIE) to conduct research and incubate MSMEs respectively. In their formative stages, these two organisations created Kenya’s industrial base that is now faltering.

Some of the major brands incubated at KIE include: Haco Industries, Mastermind Tobacco Ltd, Spectre International, Pioneer Foods, Nice & Lovely, Ramboo Furniture, Buffalo Millers, Moiben Agro-chemicals, Mareba Tiles Enterprises, Kuguru Foods, Makiga Engineering, Leather Masters, Line Plast, Specialised Towel Manufacturers and Menengai Millers.

Although Kirdi continues to support MSMEs with industrial research, resources for research have dwindled. Their good work is rarely communicated to the youth who need it most to develop products and it lags behind in technology.

KIE, after a long period of inactivity, has managed to build several industrial workspace (Parks/Sheds/Incubators) in 37 counties.

It is also revamping new products on MSMEs credit finance, built Business Advisory Services and is facilitating backward and forward linkages between large and small enterprises as well as sub-contracting.

Experience from these key organisations show that research and innovation is critical to economic expansion. Had these organisations kept the initial tempo that helped create several brands, Kenya could be industrialised today.

Nevertheless, we have an opportunity to leverage UK-Kenya Tech Hub, and hopefully a better funded Kirdi and KIE to acquire new technologies for fostering the renewed effort to grow manufacturing sector.

Emerging technologies such as additive manufacturing provide new opportunities to create new products that bring greater value to the customer.

Since the technology does not require complicated commercial infrastructure, it is likely to create several small producers addressing local demand. This will demystify the fear that new technologies will displace many people out of their jobs.

Let us communicate the benefits of research and development in all communication channels."
Bitange Ndemo,"When Kenya inaugurated a new constitution in 2010, I argued that the leadership might focus on devolution at the expense of the country’s competitiveness. As they say, ultimately, only time tells. I believe time has proven that I was right.

Barely 10 years after the advent of county governments, our inward focus has blurred any hope for replicating the example of the Newly Industrialized Countries (NICs) of Asia, which redirected their countries toward export orientation to grow their economies.

Kenya has effectively re-oriented its consciousness towards devolution and divorced herself from participating in the global market. Our leadership wants resources at the county, not to grow future revenue sources but to spend. In the financial year 2018/2019, most counties spent more than 65 per cent in recurrent expenditure and less than 25 per cent in development expenditure.

Much of the recurrent expenditure goes to the bloated staff complement employed through the cronyism of senators, members of Parliament (MPs), members of county assembly (MCAs) and governors. 

During the first nine months of 2018/2019 financial year, county executives and MCAs from the 47 counties spent Sh14.88 billion on travelling, mostly to lounge in high-end hotels around the world. No wonder Kenyans say their leaders have gone to “bed mark” instead of to “benchmark.”

As reports from the Office of the Auditor-General shows every year, county bureaucrats and leadership also steal a lot of the devolved resources. The money ends up in Nairobi where it is pumped into investments such as hotels and real estate. Some of it is also spirited abroad. The fight in the Senate about revenue allocation therefore isn’t about the citizens but an opportunity to raise funds for the 2022 electioneering. It is a season of high corruption in both national and county governments.

Their preoccupation with how much resources is going to their respective counties has taken the energy to think and change the skewed spending that Parliament approves.

There is no economy that has ever flourished on the basis of consumption only. Right thinking leaders often prioritise creation of an enabling environment and supporting revenue creation opportunities.

Among the 47 counties there are few outliers like Kitui, Makueni and West Pokot, which stand out in trying to tackle the greatest youth problem in Kenya – unemployment. Kitui County for example, has managed to demonstrate that with proper leadership, it is possible to create opportunity at local level and grow outward.

Governor Charity Ngilu, made the decision to use Sh168 million to establish the now famous Kitui County Textile Center (Kicotec).

With such a small amount, a new textile industry has emerged employing 600 workers. Yet the amount was barely enough to buy various sewing machines, build the structures and train the recruited staff.

Contrast the Sh168 million spent on the establishment of Kicotec with the Sh14.88 billion spent as travel and accommodation expense for MCA on foreign travel in nine months. By extrapolation, if Sh168 million produced 600 jobs, Sh14.88 billion would have produced 24.8 million jobs, that is, virtually a job for every youth that is looking for one.

Some counties would have produced the plastic shoes that are imported in their abundance, while others would have produced office stationery. Indeed, there are as many low-end manufacturing opportunities as there are counties.

Some of the other products that should be manufactured locally include: detergents, beauty products with local fragrances, hospital supplies, pharmaceutical and many more. Each of these will have its own multiplier effect.

The same amount could be used in agricultural value addition, production of more foods to meet local demands (for example, wheat production to reduce import bill – Kenya imports 2.4 million tones or more than 90 per cent of what it consumes in wheat). The percentage is even higher for fish and rice.

My point here is that with the travel and lodging budget, we could have easily met what is required to ensure food security and improve our faltering manufacturing sector. More importantly, with prudent and innovative investment, we would achieve Agenda Four and part of the vision 2030. Indeed, if we get into the culture of manufacturing, we would get better at it and begin to be competitive. That is how we can compete on exports. It is through exports that the country can rapidly grow just like the NICs.  I

In any case, some countries, as they move up the ladder of development, lose competitiveness in low-end manufacturing. For example, much of the low-end manufacturing in China has moved to either Vietnam or India. There isn’t any reason other than leadership why Kenya should not join the league of these emerging manufacturing nations to compete.

Every enterprise in the world started small and grew. Kicotec will eventually go through a learning curve to become a formidable textile organisation and so will many of the new enterprises I am proposing here. We must attempt to create such enterprises if we hope to get on the learning curve. Like buying a lottery ticket, you cannot win unless you have the ticket.

The same goes taking the risk to set up enterprises that create jobs and wealth. If they grow, then there will be hope for future success but at the moment our hope is premised on wrong assumptions – that we spend to attract investors – yet the operating environment is a nightmare to say the least.

We should be ashamed that we have rivers, lakes (in fact some Rift Valley lakes have expanded to double their size barely 10 years ago) and oceans but we import fish, we have land and labour but we import food, we have a young population educated in the arts and sciences but we import cheap plastics.

We have demonstrated that we can competitively produce textile but we yarn for mitumba. Although we can manufacture drugs, we import 95 per cent of our drug needs when poorer countries like Bangladesh produce 97 per cent of the requirement of drugs. We can manufacture basic things like soap but we still import hygiene products.

The pause on globalisation created by Covid-19 has given us a chance to rekindle manufacturing, create jobs and wealth. Above all we must stop squabbling over small money and do what it takes to generate revenue in every county in the country. The question in everyone’s mind should be: How can we bake a bigger cake?

Virtually every country in the world has some kind of smaller administrative units that have different funding mechanisms but we do not always hear of any disagreements as we do here in Kenya.

The difference is that most of these countries’ devolved systems create local wealth and debates are based on issues not emotional harangues that pander to the ethnic sentiment.

In most other countries, allocations from national governments are largely done based on facts and data as analysed by competent technocrats, of whom this country does not have a shortage. 

Indeed the Commission on Revenue Allocation (CRA) is full of such experts and it is precisely so that it can incorporate data in national revenue allocation that the commission was established by the 2010 constitution.

It is a pity that we cannot listen to what such experts are saying and that we do not value research-based decision-making.

If we cannot trust each other on facts generated by technocrats, then we may as well introduce the law of the jungle. "
Bitange Ndemo,"Globalisation is dead. Some top economists think that this marvel that has defined global interaction and integration among people, companies, and governments for more than 4,000 years is behind us.

In its place, an emergent multipolar world that will be dominated by China, the US and European Union is evolving.

The Economist has in the past two months carried headlines like, “Goodbye globalisation: The dangerous lure of self-sufficiency” (May 16-22, 2020) and “Globalisation is dead and we need to invent a new world order” (Jun 28, 2019). There is much more than these headlines.

In his book, The Levelling: What's Next After Globalisation, published mid last year, Michael O'Sullivan, details a world in transition. He sets the scene from historical analogy in England to explain what is happening today.

In 1640, O'Sullivan writes, a faction by the name Levellers grumbled about the notables in Oliver Cromwell’s army, immediately after their victory over Charles I in a civil war. The war elites wanted to enforce a postwar settlement without any reference to the rank and file in the army.

The ordinary members of the army, the Levellers, revolted asking, “Have you shook this nation like an earthquake to produce no more than this for us?” In a similar version, the world is waking up to an unfair system where the elites are doing things without reference to others.

The free flow of people, money, trade and ideas isn’t moving everywhere. Instead, the world is fostering economic inequality, declining political discernment, rising indebtedness and glaring disparities throughout the world's economies. O'Sullivan argues in his book that what we need next is the levelling of all these imbalances.

More specifically, what is needed is the levelling of “wealth between poor and rich countries, of power between nations and regions, of political accountability from elites to the people, and of institutional power away from central banks and defunct 20th-century institutions such as the WTO and the IMF.”

Africa fuelled globalisation for centuries by providing raw materials and labour without compensation. In truth, our forefathers were complicit in depriving the continent of its resources and exacerbating the wealth inequalities we face today. That, in my view, remains true as most African countries approach 60 years of independence have not changed. Leadership in Africa today is seen as a gateway to elitism.

Most of our founding fathers saw themselves as a replacement of the colonial rulers. Although there was a spirited fight by the academics to refocus leadership on the people, that institution was smothered. Some countries like Uganda have never recovered to date from the crude leadership of Idi Amin Dada that completely destroyed the academia.

This forced many intellectuals to move to Western countries.

The impact of exile was such that the likes of Ali Mazrui and Chinua Achebe died away from home. The African intellectualism today is basically dead. Unlike in the past, intellectual scions of the current African academics both in the continent and in the diaspora — with so much research opportunity to provide leadership — have failed to take advantage of the prevailing tension between the US and China to widen the continent’s power to negotiate.

Most important is that both academia and policymakers must articulate Africa’s role in the emerging re-alignment of power in the world, failure to which the continent might find itself playing second fiddle to the new global order.

What Africa needs now is to avoid the exploitation that it has gone through for more than 400 years. It cannot be done with the prevailing mindset of mutilating the continent into smaller nations that are not economically viable.

In Kenya, for example, the failure of nationhood led to creation of querulous devolved units.

While all and sundry say that more resources have gone to devolved units, no one is saying that the focus on devolution has negatively impacted regional and international trade as well as undermined national entrepreneurial activities.

Africa’s future power will come from how fast it integrates to a unit to create a powerful region where enterprises can scale easily."
Bitange Ndemo,"Last week Eric Latiff of Spice FM asked me to join his co-presenters, CT Muga and Ndu Okoh to participate in their show as a panelist discussing an earlier article, I had written in the Nation Online about what I had referred to as “dead capital.”

Although I have discussed this article previously, it wasn’t until last week when it struck me that no matter how poor Kenyans are, they will still invest in an unproductive asset. Culture dictates the emotional attachment that Kenyans have to their rural investments that are of practically no productive value at all. 

My initial definition of the term, dead capital, was in reference to investments in assets that have no value. However, it was first coined by a Peruvian economist Hernando de Soto to explain capital in the form of unregistered real property, which is considered lost value because the landholder is unable to transfer or leverage his property for capital or capital access.

Investments in shanty areas are largely dead capital since they cannot use the property to raise capital. It is estimated that $93 trillion dollars are invested in such properties across the world.

In Kenya, we have a segment of similar property that falls within realms of dead capital. These are the rural shopping centers that are built for prestige, not as an income-generating asset. Some $20 billion lie idle in the villages. Another $5 billion is buried in second homes of the urbanites who travel perhaps once a year to sleep in their mansions.

I am not against people spending their money in whatever way they choose. It is their choice after all.  But there is need for a mindset change because we have invested more than $50 billion in non-productive assets thereby setting ourselves on a destructive path.

Those who’ve had the privilege to have an education should serve as a bridge between the old and new generations. Whereas the old generation considered home to mean the village, in current times home should be where we live. There is a strong argument for reversing such a cultural practice.

First, is the impact of property ownership that is undermining the livelihood of current and future generations by building everywhere even as others move to urban areas. A casual time series review of land usage in my village will shock you. 

As a small boy in the 1970’s, we ate wild fruits of all kind and even hunted rabbits. As I write this article, much of the flora and fauna has been decimated. The entire land has been invaded by tin roofed houses (see picture Google Earth aerial pictures below). My home is at Isecha and as you can see, I contributed to reducing average land size to less than two acres per person. Culturally, my son and nephews are expected to each put up a house since they cannot inherit my house. Clearly, it does make no sense to pile up properties that bring no return.  Land is a finite resource that is not just for those living now but also those who will be coming. We can manage this resource better to support livelihood which current practices cannot sustain. Each home requires at least a quarter acre of land. Yet we know it is an investment that will never be optimally utilized. Above is Farvagny, a village in Switzerland with a population of 2,250. I visited here while studying in Europe. Land use in this rural town with unemployment rate of 3 percent is a serious matter. Although it is rural, people live in an urban setting. Some live in small apartments and when there grown up children come to visit once a year, they stay at a motel, which provides employment for those who remained behind. Their loved ones are either cremated or buried at a cemetery in order to sustainably manage their land resources.

My second point centers around the structure of the local economy to create markets and utilize local resources. The economic structure in Farvagny is such that only 78 people are involved in the primary sector, 250 in the secondary sector and the rest in the service and knowledge sectors.

The aspect of planning even on the number of additional housing to be built and where it will be built is critical to the community’s livelihood as well as cost containment.  Infrastructure like energy and water becomes cheaply accessible given that housing is not scattered all over the place.

In contrast, this meticulous planning contradicts our free for all decision making on where to build without any planning. Instead of the big house in the village, we should help structure the local economies such that our folks don’t grow similar produce and cash crops that in the event of crop failure, they all suffer. We should also jointly invest in motels that enhance shared economy and enhanced eco-tourism.

Any future thoughts of a house in the village should be converted into a pool fund to build value adding industries to eliminate waste in the agricultural sector.  Such a move, will lead to a multiplier effect that will create jobs, lower incidences of poverty and improve productivity as well as food security.

The change could lead to the creation of large enterprises that will begin to scale outwards. Our prosperity is not in our inward focus but in the ability to seek to conquer the world. 

Africa has invested far too much dead capital for cultural reasons. It is time that this wasteful practice stopped. Let people make homes in places where they have settled.

We should work towards enabling those in our ancestral lands to change their lives for better by encouraging planning with a sustainable future in mind."
Bitange Ndemo,"How to make Kenya Airways  (KQ) a profitable national flag carrier is not a new debate. Many, including this columnist, have chipped in on numerous occasions.

There are many successful national carriers as well as struggling ones. Although Kenya Airways is currently fighting to survive, it can be made to be competitive again.

Most countries with national airlines try to make them competitive through incentives, preferential treatment and protecting the markets. Therefore, subjecting KQ to the skewed competitive advantage posed by State-owned airlines in Africa and the Middle East is undermining a public investment.

Free market economy in the airline industry in developing countries has failed to work in the past.

Competitors such as those from the Gulf region use different tactics and by and large do not embrace a similar economic thinking. It is a joke to think that KQ can effectively compete with highly subsidised Gulf region airlines that dominate long-haul flights.

The airline market structure in Africa is not similar to other areas like the US where deregulation of the airline industry played a key role in the growth of the sector.

The one-size-fits-all rule doesn’t apply in some markets and copying it is harmful to the long-term investment agenda for developing countries.

The turbulent economic times that airlines face today are not just caused by the pandemic but by the exponential growth of speculative money from capital deregulation. It is what led to the financial meltdown in 2008.

At the time, the KQ stock soared to Sh 147 before tumbling down toSh3.80, a pale shadow of its former value. More precisely, neo-liberalism which underpins free market economy, caused wider economic inequality than if we had trudged on with other models of economic management.

There are people who bought the stock at Sh100 thinking that they had made investments for their retirement but other people far away from home played poker games on the stocks and practically impoverished local investors.

As the government gears to rescue Kenya Airways there are fundamental considerations that must be in place in order to build a sustainable enterprise.

The first one is the principle of reciprocity. In areas where foreign airlines are allowed to operate in Kenya, KQ must have a similar opportunity in their home countries.

Some airlines enjoy day time flights into the country but in their home turf, KQ is only allowed to use their airports in hours that disadvantage the airline. The open skies policy indeed presumes a reciprocal relationship but in most cases some airlines have taken advantage of that to fly into Nairobi and Mombasa to the detriment of KQ.

Cargo business is increasingly becoming a key revenue source for the airlines. This segment of business should favour KQ just as other countries in the region do. In my view, the airline should be linked to Vision 2030 so that instead of the country importing cocoa from Europe for the nascent chocolate industry in Nairobi, the country should foster a relationship with West African producers in the spirit of African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA) to import the raw material directly.

The airline should be a catalyst for intra-Africa trade linking by synchronising different key sectors and creating greater economic value.

Whilst Ghana imports over $ 300 million (about 180,000 tonnes) worth of chicken annually from Brazil and the European Union, Kenya should up its game in poultry for export to Ghana while importing some of the raw materials from West Africa.

It is an opportunity to grow the airline as well as intra-Africa trade.

Jambojet, KQ’s low-cost carrier, should aggressively grow domestically and regionally and support the airline’s long-haul business to truly make Nairobi the core hub of Africa’s aviation industry. "
Bitange Ndemo,"For weeks now, the Senate has been politicking to find the right formula to allocate revenues to County Governments. Politics, however, is not a science. 

To determine the best way to allocate resources, we need data science.  Without data, no matter how much politics weighs in, someone will still feel affronted by whatever formula. 

An argument is won by data and strong evidence. Any other means is palaver. Intimidating others to win support for a non-scientific allocation formula indeed exacerbates the problem since it draws the attention of the public in the wrong direction and breeds mistrust.  

In their wisdom, the Commission on Revenue Allocation (CRA) proposed a formula, for the senate to debate and approve. Logically, the debate should be centred around the proportions allocated to each of the determinant factors. Instead, politicians are shelving issue-based arguments and targeting people's emotions. 

The nearest the senators have come to explain their differences on the proposed formula is that the allocation must be equitable and must address historical injustices. In which case they should be giving counter offers of the proposed proportions. The math is that simple, but the political mindset is not.

None of the politicians has defined what equitable means, neither have they proposed what will constitute sufficient compensation of historical injustices to the formula proposed by CRA. None has also shown who is specifically from which county or counties responsible for the historical injustices. 

The vocal politicians are simply guided by mindset, often evident in the form of what is referred to by psychologists as cognitive bias, which in most cases leads to wrong conclusions and actions. In politics, biases are hard to deal with. That is why there is what political scientists call democratic compromise.  

In a country like Kenya where there is deep-rooted mistrust, terms like democratic compromise do not exist neither do our politicians have any principles that can help in predicting why they support or disagree on major policy decisions.  

It is perhaps why Mohandas Gandhi once said that ""politics without principle"", (lacking truth(s) to justify our actions), will unfortunately in the final analysis create chaos. Gandhi called these indiscretions ""passive violence"", “which fuels the active violence of crime, rebellion, and war.” 

He defined principle as, ""the expression of perfection,” and admonished that  “as imperfect beings like us cannot practice perfection, we devise every moment limits of its compromise in practice."" 

In the past, it is our imperfections that led us into violence. The more we fail to make reasoned arguments and truths based on facts, the less we create an opportunity for compromise and inability to necessitate peaceful co-existence that fosters sustainable economic development.

The aspect of historical injustices has been addressed in many ways in our constitutional design but it somehow lingers in our national discourse. The proposed revenue allocation formula has attempted to address the same based on poverty, land area and to some extent equal share factors. 

Whilst population factor deals with the aspect of equity, fiscal and development factors are largely incentives to do better for the counties.

There is nothing wrong with the structure of the formula. With data, it is easy to make arguments around these factors to avoid the current utterances that could easily trigger hate crimes. 

As it is, we forget too quickly having courted chaos in 2007/2008. Both the Kriegler and Waki Commissions revealed that the underlying causes of violence were deep-rooted social structures and historical injustices that previous governments had failed to address.

As a result, several instruments including the 2010 Constitution sought to address the injustices. It is absurd that politicians are not using these instruments to make their arguments in a more open-minded way that allows for compromise. Further, besides the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics, there are multiple sources of data that can be used more accurately not just to provide historical data but predictive data to enable decision makers understand their arguments from a position of knowledge. Such data includes the Household surveys, the Demographic surveys, the Huduma Number data, and data from NGO officials. We can avoid the dangerous statements that we make without the basis of data.

What we want to see from politicians is for them to show clearly from data (structured and unstructured) why they need more resources than the other counties based on the parameters proposed.  For example, a senator from Tana River can use satellite data to show the impact of climate change and the flooding that goes on there as a one-time solution to minimize death from natural calamities. Next would probably be Busia to once and for all deal with the perennial flooding. 

In so doing, the beginning point should be the number of people affected by the perennial disaster. 

In my view, the senators ought to be acting tough on their counties to be more accountable with whatever little that is allocated to them. If they did, they would probably understand what Czech American author Martina Boone meant when she said, “It doesn't matter how great your shoes are if you don't accomplish anything in them.”

Any analysis on how counties spent their allocations will show that it did not matter how big the cake they received from county allocations but when you look on the ground, you can hardly see any accomplishment. If a bucket leaks, the logical thing you do is not to fight and add more water but first seal the loopholes. 

Our political class is behaving badly. They have no principles to help them make political compromises. They use very little data if any to make gigantic decisions. Instead they use emotional appeals. That should not be the way to govern a country that needs peace to economically prosper. "
Bitange Ndemo,"The reign of Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s in the UK and the US respectively saw the world witness the resurgence of neoliberalism.

The 19th century ideas of free market capitalism mostly associated with privatisation, deregulation, globalisation and free trade came to occupy the centre stage in economic thought. The World Bank bought the idea and pushed many developing countries into privatising state enterprises.

In 1996, the government, after spirited resistance, caved in and privatised Kenya Airways, making it the first airline in the entire continent to go that direction. While most developing countries embraced the idea of privatisation, some, notably Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Malaysia and even China took a different trajectory. They decided to corporatise — a model that uses features and behaviours employed by private corporations — autonomous from government to bring efficiency gains.

Australia’s response to the privatisation movement was in the form of commercial reforms bill of 1987 that led to the corporatisation of Qantas Airways among other state enterprises. The bill sought to remove over 40 long-standing controls from its Government Business Enterprises (GBEs).

In a 1998 brief — Reforming Public Enterprises in Australia — to the OECD, John Marsden of Marsden Jacob and Associates said that some of the changes included: their right to enter into contracts without ministerial approval, exemption from processes under the Public Works Committee Act of 1969, and their ability to invest surplus monies and enter loan contracts without government approval.

There were further changes like the right of the board to dismiss the chief executive, the removal of many public service staffing and administrative practices, and their right to establish their own superannuation schemes.

The government, however, set up a mechanism for setting clear GBE objectives, including strategic directions, financial targets and distribution policies.

It also improved reporting requirements to both relevant ministers and the parliament while ensuring some autonomy.

The Kenyan government in its wisdom has set in motion the transport sector reforms through the National Aviation Management Bill, 2020. It is nothing near what most countries did with their state-owned enterprises. It is worse than the pre-1996 legal framework when government interfered with the operations of the airline and virtually bankrupted it through a bloated labour force.

The Bill creates a three-tier governance structure, including a National Civil Aviation Council chaired by the Head of State, a board that that is largely government and management.

This model did not work when Kenya Airways was a public entity and there is nothing to show that it will work now. The Bill doesn’t even exempt the new entity from some legislation that bogs down the public sector.

On public procurement, it gives the Cabinet Secretary powers to decide what to exempt. We have the benefit of learning from other countries that avoided privatisation and opted for corporatisation. It is not just sector reforms that will turn around KQ. At the moment, the airline must do what other airlines are doing — embark on workforce rationalisation — and create a more effective structure. Whether sector reforms go through or not, they have no choice but to make the decisions now.

In the recent past, virtually every airline has cut as much as 50 percent of the workforce as a strategy to weather the current storm caused by Covid-19. It is predicted that in the best-case scenario, the earliest that airlines could make profits is after 2023.

In my view, the initial bailout should be in the form of incentives for a voluntary early retirement programme to avoid a clash with the unions. Indeed, if the unions were clever, they could propose a soft-landing programme unlike what we are seeing in all major airlines."
Bitange Ndemo,"The discussion on whether to re-open schools against the advice of health experts is not wise at all. Ordinarily, whenever you encounter a problem with your planned agenda, you seek the best alternative.

On two occasions along the escapement as you climb into Nairobi, I have had to drive back to Naivasha to use the alternative road. The change in both cases was necessitated by accidents that closed the narrow road for hours.

As it is always with mid-stream change of strategy, it was not my choice to drive back in order to go forward. This simple analogy perhaps explains the situation that the entire world is in with respect to education. We cannot use the well-tested road, but there is an alternative.  

The Covid-19 pandemic is unprecedented and no one will with any confidence tell you when it will be over. We simply have to help ourselves with whatever we have. Fortunately, much of the education curricula now is in digital formats.

Technology has made it possible to deliver education to virtually every child at a cheaper cost than the current industrial model using the factory line mould. The problem is that people take a long time to change especially where they are used to certain conveniences.

That we can experiment with our children at the risk of contracting a dangerous viral disease in order for us to be able to get time to go to work or do other things is ridiculous. 

Some teachers fear the mention of the word computer, which they see as the enemy that will destroy their future. The future will affect everybody in the workplace and the only secret to sustaining your job is lifelong learning.

For parents and teachers, it is time to take greater responsibility in bringing up our children. Even without Covid-19, it was clear that the education system was not helping the economy become more competitive. 

The time for rote learning is over. The economy needs productive workers and not parrots reciting what they have learnt. We must see Covid-19 as a massive opportunity to introduce new modes of teaching with less expenditure. In the 2020/21 budget, education received Sh505.2 billion or approximately $50 billion, much of it going to the Teachers Service Commission (TSC) for recurrent expenditure (mostly teachers’ salaries).

Earlier, a significant amount of money was spent in providing last mile infrastructure (electricity and broadband) to schools. Reports from the ICT Board indicate that already 97 percent of the schools have these infrastructures. 

Devices remain a challenge but savings from the past eight months that students have stayed at home could very easily buy tablets for every primary and high school child. At least we could start with candidates in standard 8 and Form IV.  

Indeed, in the past, teachers and many other people studied at home to join Universities. They were referred to as private students. Many of them passed to change their careers. How is that it is difficult to do the same today? We could do even better since communication technologies have enabled us to access educational content anytime.  

If there was enough will, there would be a way in this sustained standoff between the waiters of normalcy and mavericks who want to give technology a chance.  

In my discussions with teachers and other stakeholders, the major issue that they believe cannot be resolved by digital solutions is the aspect of exams. The exam issue was also echoed at a recent UNESCO Covid-19 Education Webinar.

The Ugandan Director, Basic and Secondary Education, Ministry of Education, Mr Ismael Mulindwa, said: “We cannot do away with exams - parents believe in them, so does the wider community.” 

He further explained that high stake exams are considered an “ultimate outcome” of the education system. 

“It’s a very fragile situation. Parents and students are worried.” 

To adapt, the Ugandan Government is reviewing the curriculum and moving towards formative assessments. Mr Mulindwa noted that “We emphasise self- assessments and home-based assessment, so that at the end of the day, when they come back to school, they have not lost too much.” Clearly, Uganda has a clear way forward.

A Unesco survey of several countries revealed that 58 countries of them have postponed or rescheduled exams, 23 introduced alternative methods such as online or home-based testing, 22 maintained exams while in 11 countries, they were cancelled altogether. 

Kenya postponed exams to April 2021 even  though there is no indication that the pandemic will ease out by then.

Unesco’s Gwang-Chol Chang noted a distinct trend towards online testing, but he emphasised that “not all subjects and competencies can be assessed online or by phone.” 

Looking beyond school closures, he advised that “we need to assess learners’ progress to identify learning gaps, and offer remedial and accelerated learning and assessment when schools reopen.” This perhaps is what the country ought to be doing at the moment.

From the Unesco webinar, it was clear that the problem of examinations was a southern hemisphere issue. Many states in the northern hemisphere use standardised assessment models that students can take any time they feel ready to take the exam. 

In some cases, students can re-take the exam unlike the southern hemisphere where exams are used to limit access to the university. It's about time we embraced standardised assessments. 

I could be wrong in my assumptions but in my view, such postulations can orchestrate a national debate on the best way forward in education. The tendency to just sit and wait could eventually turn out to be an expensive process. 

Nobody in the world can predict with certainty when the pandemic will be over but we can work around it just like taking a detour when the road is blocked ahead.   

In fact, there is evidence that the virus is going nowhere and there may never be a vaccine. There have been a number of coronaviruses and none has a vaccine. We perhaps should be thinking of a permanent new normal."
Bitange Ndemo,"One of the major reasons why some micro and small enterprises (MSEs) prefer being in the informal sector is fear of compliance with regulatory requirements.

However, failure to comply has unintended repercussions. MSEs operating informally cannot access credit due to lack of information about their existence — Know Your Customer (KYC). Neither can they qualify for lucrative tenders. In summary, they will forever live in the margins of poverty.

It is important that these enterprises that employ the majority in developing countries be assisted to scale and move up the ladder to become formal, sustainable contributors to economic growth.

Digitalisation is the surest bet to change this grim picture for MSEs. Simple reforms at the company registry could easily change the fortunes of these enterprises. Local authorities have records of virtually every MSE operating in their areas. However, the data is neither shared nor get domiciled at the registrar of companies.

A change in legislation could enable shared information, leading to formal registration of MSE followed by incentives like a five-year tax exemption. Since the company registry is already digitalised, an enabling software intermediary (Application Programming Interface or simply API) will be required to allow the existing database to talk to other databases, including banks and regulatory agencies.

Such an infrastructure will facilitate business verification through open API for MSEs and individuals as a single point of truth to transform the entrepreneurial landscape in the country. As e-commerce platforms expand and create new enterprises, MSEs should not lose out for lack of trust. This lack of verification is holding back even the stimulus package meant for MSEs due to the burden of KYC for lenders.

With the API, KYC becomes easier, for new clients can validate the existence of the MSE without going through third parties, and the regulators will implement hard-to-enforce regulations such as anti-money laundering. At the same time, the tax authorities will expand the tax base, improve MSEs’ ability to access formal markets and become more productive with prospects of scalability.

Further MSEs will start providing better quality, well paid, more sustainable jobs, improve reliability of contracts between companies, and build investor confidence especially at Nairobi Securities Exchange’s (NSE) Growth Enterprise Market.

It will also enable the formal financial sector to provide resources to the MSEs, freeing them from shylocks who are currently fleecing them.

Lest we forget, the traditional model of economic transformation is to move from petty trade, informality and subsistence agriculture to industrialisation, services and knowledge economy. If we ever want to move out of replicative and wasteful entrepreneurial activity, we must guide the MSE sector out of their misery that benefits only a few lords of poverty into a modern economy that creates sustainable jobs with living wages. This can best be done through better visibility and traceability of these enterprises to establish greater trust.

The dark cloud under which MSEs operate undermines their success. Take, for example, the case of Gikomba Market. With open API, traders in this famed place in Nairobi will access insurance. As it is at the moment, a few moneyed people hound them with fires that destroy their hard-earned investments. Sham investigations often fail to help but with insurance, this could change as they have the influence to have better investigations from both the government and media.

Open API will also enhance existing infrastructure for validation without which many of the services that we enjoy today like mobile money will not be in existence. The Huduma Namba will even do better to enable entrepreneurial activity in the country like never before."
Bitange Ndemo,"A report by the African Development Bank (AfDB) titled, East Africa Economic Outlook 2020: Coping with Covid-19 pandemic, confirms the worries economists have about the region’s emerging development model, which is somewhat different from the traditional growth paths of other countries in the world.

The history of virtually all developed countries was that economic transformation moved from agrarian economy to industrialisation before diversifying into service and knowledge economies. Now, AfDB boldly reports that the East African economic structure is transforming with the services sector becoming more dominant.

That kind of change from agrarian to service industry still puzzles economists. There are those who argue that Africa’s only hope is to industrialise. The World Economic Forum on the other hand says Africa's future is innovation rather than industrialisation. Others even propose that the continent pursue manufacturing as well as services. There is no consensus that there can be real development by leapfrogging manufacturing into a service economy.

John Page, a former senior official of the World Bank, says in his recent Brookings Institution article, that economists have long regarded structural change—the movement of workers from lower to higher productivity employment—as essential to growth in low-income countries.

But Africa’s development path is diverging from the well-tested development model into a new realm and hence the reason there are differing views. Page says new technologies have spawned a growing number of services and agro-industries—including horticulture—that share many characteristics with manufacturing.

These emerging businesses are what Page and his co-authors, Newfarmer and Tarp, refer to as “industries without smokestacks,” in their 2018 book. They characterise these industries as “tradable, have high value added per worker, and can absorb large numbers of moderately skilled workers. Like manufacturing, they benefit from technological change, productivity growth, scale, and agglomeration economies.”

The authors of the AfDB report, however, have no doubts. The report seems to celebrate the idea that the contribution of agriculture to East Africa’s GDP declined from an average of 33.4 percent at the turn of the millennium to 28.3 percent in 2018. This was against an increase in the contribution of services to GDP from 44.6 percent in the early 2000s to 53.8 percent in 2018.

The change is more prominent in Seychelles, Eritrea, Kenya and Rwanda where services contribute 80 percent, 67 percent, 60 percent and 47 percent of GDP respectively. The GDP growth rates have dwarfed those of other countries with a slightly different model. In the region, Ethiopia stands out with its much more traditional development model.

Between 2008 and 2018, the share of agriculture in Ethiopia's gross domestic product declined from 45 percent to 31.19 percent. Manufacturing’s contribution increased from 10 percent to 27.26 percent and that of the services declined marginally from 38 percent to 37 percent. Ethiopia’s economy grew at double digits for most of the past 10 years.

The entry of Covid-19 brings new dimensions to the debate around the best development model that Africa should pursue.

AfDB in its report urges policy makers to reform education systems by linking universities and other tertiary institutions such as TVETs with industry; and integrating higher learning skills in the curricula by remodeling the syllabi to create critical and creative thinkers who are emotionally intelligent to fit in an automated and ICT-intensive society.

It is upon Africa to decide with conviction on which development model to pursue. The decision will then help to design the kind of strategies Africa needs to succeed."
Bitange Ndemo,"In the past three months alone, I have spoken to twelve different groups about the future of work. 

It wasn’t my choice but somehow each group had an interest in this topic and somehow, the subject kept rearing its head. 

What I have since noted is that people are anticipating better jobs in the future.

On social media, we’ve had debates about losing jobs, and the platforms are replete with testimonies from those who have already unfortunately lost their jobs. 

There is serious change going on, and it comes with both pain but also with blessings. It also depends on how one takes in the reality of suddenly becoming jobless. Any job will come to an end at some point whether we like it or not. My philosophy has always been to move on and do what it takes to put the food on the table. 

It always helps to live within your own means and always have a plan B at all times even when holding what you might perceive as the most secure job.

In the not too distant future, and as the 4th industrial revolution intensifies, technology will reorganise most of the jobs that we do today. 

Some people will forever become unemployed but at the same time many will begin doing new jobs that they never anticipated in their lives.  

The new type of jobs will require new skill sets - both higher-level, specialised skills to meet new industry standards as well as non-cognitive 21st century competencies in critical thinking, creativity and communication. 

As with the introduction of other technologies in earlier periods, these new technologies are likely to dislocate some workers especially those in routine jobs which could easily be automated and therefore hurting those unable to reskill and upskill. 

However, the net effect will be positive.

Digital technologies, in particular, are driving transformations across many industries such as banking, agriculture, transportation, and retail.  Many of these sectors currently employ large numbers of people in the informal sector. 

These transformations require a range of skills from basic digital skills and literacy for users to advanced digital skills for those who can help to create new applications and business. The government of Kenya has already initiated a free digital literacy programme throughout the country.

The government is also rapidly digitising in order to transform the country into a digital economy. Even the worst critic of government agrees that digitisation has made things better, improved the country’s indices in terms of doing business and we can transact with government from the comfort of our homes.

Improved digital infrastructure has attracted investors, with new business models and creating low-end jobs. Virtually every major digital platform is here bringing the joy of convenience but also the pain of using our data without consent.  

The changes tell us to develop new human resource capacities such as cybersecurity experts, data analysts, machine learning engineers, research scientist, big data engineers/architects and business intelligence developers.
 
To rapidly develop such capacities, the mind-set of our education policy makers has to change and so are the universities to shift their focus from theory to more applied sciences. We have no choice in this especially now that the government is committed to competence-based curriculum that is currently being implemented in primary schools. 

Without preparing to take up such jobs in the days to come, many of us will be confined to menial jobs that platforms offer. The emergence of the digital economy requires updating regulatory frameworks to address the mischief of new platforms that come with complex business models.

There are also opportunities in mid-level jobs. If we get it right in human resource capacity development, it could spark millions of jobs not just within the country but also attract global jobs into the country.  

In such a strategy, opportunities for entrepreneurship in apps development are abundant. There are many jobs in digital marketing, digital graphic design, desktop publishing, research, data analytics, business process outsourcing. 
 
The challenge is that output per a person employed in the region compares poorly to North and Southern Africa.  

It is an area Africa must generally pay attention to. Output per person or labour efficiency and productivity is something that should be part of our DNA. It can be improved by always examining per unit costs of inputs and always adjusting the firm’s inputs accordingly. 

Our competitiveness is not the abundant of workers but our productivity.

The digital economy is taking shape in Africa. A January 2020 Brookings Institution article, The Fourth Industrial Revolution and digitisation will transform Africa into a global powerhouse, by Njuguna Ndung’u and Landry Signé notes that mobile technologies and services have generated 1.7 million direct jobs (both formal and informal), contributed to $144 billion of economic value (8.5 percent of the GDP of sub-Saharan Africa), and contributed $15.6 billion to the public sector through taxation.

In Eastern Africa for example, a few countries within the region have improved their competitiveness in such areas as higher education and training, labour market efficiency, technological readiness and innovativeness among other interventions. 

We need to pay more attention along the lines of competitiveness if indeed Africa is to play a key role in the future of work.

There is a high correlation between country competitiveness and participation in the digital economy as well as export of ICT services.  

The global competitiveness report 2019 also ranks Mauritius (52nd) top among the African and EA countries. Other countries from the region include Kenya (95th), Rwanda (100th), Uganda (115th), Tanzania (117th) and Ethiopia (126th) out of 141 countries in the world. Kenya and Mauritius also happen to the top African countries in ICT exports.

As of 2019, there were 634 tech clusters in Africa of which 113 were in East Africa with most (50) of them in Kenya. The Partech Africa Report of 2019, which covers equity deals in tech and digital spaces with funding rounds higher than $200,000, says, 234 African tech startups raised $2.02 billion in 2019. Nigeria took the lion’s share ($747 million) followed by Kenya ($564 million), Egypt ($211), Rwanda ($126) and South Africa ($205). 

There is real opportunity for Africa to play a key role in the future of work but a lot has to change for the continent to effectively participate in the emerging industrial revolution that underpins the future. "
Bitange Ndemo,"The Covid-19 pandemic is throwing a curved ball at us. It has made planning virtually impossible. The interventions we made in March are not the ones we need today, and it is possible that in the coming days we may have to improvise strategies to deal with the pandemic.

The question people are asking is: How are we to live with uncertainty as a norm? The answer lies in military intelligence that leverages on a strategic planning method known as “scenario analysis”, also called “scenario thinking” or “scenario planning”.

While the Government is working on health intervention and economic recovery scenarios, organisations, both private and public, as well as individuals, are beginning to look at scenarios beyond the pandemic.

Economists Anzetse Were of the Financial Sector Deepening Trust (FSD Kenya), and Amolo Ng’weno of Bankable Frontier Associates shared thoughts on the FSD Kenya blog on economic recovery.

For Kenya to realise a robust and inclusive recovery, they argued, it needs to include, or even be led by livelihoods of individuals actively earning incomes from the informal sector — the cuspers — people on the cusp of escaping poverty but are at risk of falling back into it.

FSD Kenya postulates that finance could promote the recovery of real sector livelihoods of Kenyan ‘cuspers’ ravaged by Covid-19.

Like the military does in times of war, they took an agile scenario process to create three macroeconomic trajectories, that is, Kenya limping back, falling back or bouncing back.

The bounceback, which is more optimistic, assumes that economic growth will resume in late 2020 with reasonable growth levels by mid- 2021. The limpback is projected to be more draining with slower recovery that will ease in 2023. Under fallback, it could be devastating to the economy and will take us back to the lower growth rates of the 1990s, with signs of recovery beyond 2023. In all scenarios, digitisation will play a key role.

These scenarios were used to tell their story of cuspers based on data, about how the future might unfold. Their analysis is based on the assumption that cuspers are generally differentiated and that women, who form the majority of this group, may be especially vulnerable.

An online survey by BFA, The Impact of Covid-19 on Financial Lives in Eight Countries, conducted last April established that 79-81 percent of low- and moderate-income Kenyans reported income somewhat or significantly reduced as a result of the pandemic.

Further, the survey noted, conventional coping strategies to survive shocks such as increasing income through casual work, and receiving remittances from friends and family have been reduced.

Although cuspers are the engine room of an inclusive economic recovery, they suffer from financial vulnerability in times of crisis. Without social protection in the informal sector and practical livelihood strategies, the study says the poverty gap could grow and inequality increase within this large group of people that supports dependents. As such, any scenario driven by the recovery of the formal sector alone risks squeezing this group into welfare dependency.

Through the lenses of cuspers, there are interventions that can be made based on each scenario. Success of a bounceback scenario will depend on what the government does to stimulate the economy. So far, of the $503 million stimulus announced, only $3 million will directly go to the informal sector.

A limpback scenario may be painful depending on the source of livelihood, in terms of the sectors the cuspers are in.

A fallback scenario will overwhelm the informal sector owing to the fact that there will be less demand for goods and services.

The authors of the FSD Kenya blog post reiterate that the scenarios are not predictions but rather the unfolding stories to bring a clear picture of who is being impacted.

The Government ought to support the recovery of the informal sector. "
Bitange Ndemo,"George Bernard Shaw made the following observation: “If history repeats itself, and the unexpected always happens, how incapable must Man be of learning from experience.” 
Flipping through my WhatsApp messages, I was captivated by one video post in which, lions were collaborating in a hunt. I paused to watch what was a really intense moment of life and death.  The lionesses took the lead, with their matriarch seemingly guiding them along every step. A dazzle of zebras, fifty meters away, were unaware of the plan. In a split second, the lead lioness crushed one zebra into the ground. The rest joined to finish the job.

As the zebra wriggled for its last breadth, a male lion appeared with a roar that sent the lionesses scampering for their lives. Although the male lion takes the leadership responsibility of the pride and was part of the strategy, its role in the kill is often minimal. Often, males have been known to drive the targeted animals towards the ambush of the lionesses, but they always appear to unfairly benefit from the kill more than the real workhorses, hence the phrase, “the lion’s share.”

It struck me that this was analogous to life. That no matter how history repeats itself, we always elect leaders who tell us the same things our grandparents were promised. At independence, leaders told us that we elect them so that they can bring development. We always expect them to build roads, schools and hospitals, but then the unexpected always happens. Is it possible that we are incapable of learning from experience?

In the lion kingdom, it is expected that male lions will eat first, followed by the lionesses and the cubs last. As we work like lionesses and taking salary cuts, some of our leaders have other intentions. Since March, Members of Parliament (MPs) and Members of Count Assemblies (MCAs) have been quietly pushing for more allowances although some of the allowances they want were scrapped by the Salaries and Remuneration Commission. This is in total disregard of the prevailing conditions of stalled global economies as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.

I have since discovered that even in the animal kingdom, some animals’ behaviour patterns are better than that of lions. I watched a pack of wild dogs hunting a gazelle. Their strategy centers on stamina and positioning themselves in such a way that they can eventually wear out the fast-moving gazelle. Once they manage to make the kill, they share the meal peacefully and even remember to take the meat to their elderly, the injured, the sick, cubs and the caretakers that didn’t join them in the hunt.

Leadership of a pride of lions and a pack of wild dogs determines the outcome.  Many of the leadership theories come from studying behaviour pattern in order to predict leadership outcomes.  Prior to the advent of Western civilisation, Africans had their own methods of choosing their leaders.

The process often took very long as the community studied the behaviour patterns of potential leaders – sometimes based on lineage – but what they sought to know was always if the person had the interests of the people at heart. This they referred to as Mtu wa watu (Swahili), Omonto bwa abanto (Kisii), Mundu wa andu (Kikuyu), part of the Ubuntu (Nguni Bantu) worldview.

There is no direct translation of these words but they are variously thought to mean a person with humanity in them or in other words an empathetic person who has a worldview that is larger than himself. Africans could see these qualities in a young person who will go through apprenticeship for several years before they take up leadership. Dylan McGarry says that apprenticeship is perhaps the oldest form of education and is closely related to transformative leadership and intergenerational learning, as traditionally it consisted of the transfer of knowledge from skilled (usually older) and more experienced members of society to younger generations. Parents too were supposed to take their children through apprenticeship.

It is this leadership process that we have destroyed in favour of other approaches to leadership development assuming that traditional education as we know of it today will produce the leadership we want. In leadership, it is not how much education you have or how little educated you are. It is how much humane you are. It takes time to see this in people before they are bestowed with leadership.

There are indeed theories of leadership that come closer to the old African model of identifying and apprenticing leaders. J. Robert Clinton carried out several studies of Christian leaders—Biblical, historical, and living. His work, The Making of a Leader, centered at formulating a method of identifying the incidents involved in the development of a leader's capacity to lead, which he referred to as leadership emergence.

He eventually realised that “a great leader is shaped over a long period of time, and that this formation is not automatic”. He defined his theory of leadership emergence as “the overall process in which God is at work in selecting that leader. It is the broad life-time process in which a potential leader expands capacity for influencing to become the leader God wants him or her to be.”

Further, he noted that throughout the life of a leader, certain incidents happen that shape the leader’s character, leadership skills, and leadership values. This is not a one-off thing, but an ongoing process. His conclusion was that “Leadership selection is a lifetime process in which God continues to ‘select’ leaders for leadership responsibilities at higher and higher levels.”

The kind of leadership that we have is one where individual force themselves into leadership positions based on either money or education. The outcomes have always been disastrous. As we approach the 2022 elections, many prospective candidates are busy looking for consultants to identify issues in counties where they plan to run for office.

Many have no clue about the history of their constituencies and care very little about the problems of the people they want to lead. They say their money will give them the seat. That is not the leadership we want.  Such leaders just want to be the king Lion, which eats before those who are more deserving. Let us be more thoughtful as we make our electoral decisions this time round. "
Abigail Arunga,"The third instalment of Taken 3 was released in Kenyan cinemas on Jan 9. It has seen a good crowd of movie goers hitting the cinemas to check it out, and for good reason.

Once again, Brian Mills stars as the man who has something taken away from him.

You would think that 'bad guys' would have learnt by now not to mess with Liam Neeson – sorry, Brian Mills – but it would appear they haven't.

In this movie, Brian is older, settling into an older person's life – the typical going running every morning and having a bagel type life without too much drama.

He still loves his daughter, who is now living with her boyfriend, but in a new complication, he wants to get back with his ex-wife, mother to his child, Lenore.

Unfortunately, Lenore is still married to Stuart, and Stuart wants Brian to stay away from her, whether or not Lenore wants the same thing.

Meanwhile, shady deals are going down that result in the next victim Brian has to find and avenge – Lenore.

The pace is quite quick – some of the action sequences are too quick to follow, but still enjoyable to see how far Mills is willing to go to kill people and blow up things.

The storyline is basic, thankfully – Taken 3 knows it is an action movie and doesn't try too hard to be much more.

Neeson, as usual, gives a good action hero performance, but you can see he is getting old. I am sure the producers have already started to scout around to see who they can use for Taken 4 (movies never end anymore. There must be as many sequels milked out as long as possible). Perhaps his daughter?

It gets a 7 out of 10 from me, which is rather high according to Rotten Tomatoes. Reviewers have not been kind to this instalment, but if you liked the other ones, and you like Liam Neeson, then you'll probably like this one...and even see Taken 4.

Abigail Arunga,"She is a food photographer, food stylist, blogger and recipe developer.

1. What comprises a good recipe, in your opinion?

It needs to be simple, efficient and bold in terms of flavour. I am a huge fan of slow cooked meals because the oven or cooker does most of the hard work as I get on with other things.

2. What does food styling entail? Is that something you can learn in school?

Well, food styling is a form of art. It is all about making food look fresh and camera ready, whether the pictures are to be used for marketing or TV commercials. There is a lot that goes into creating the perfect burger for the camera. There are online educational sources as well as schools where you can get all this knowledge.

3. Did you have a passion for photography or did it just tie in with your blogging?

My first passion has always been cooking and as an artist, I needed to find a medium to express this. So I started my blog www.dinewithjemutai.com so that I could learn and practice food photography and also so that my friends could find my recipes. Eventually I became so excited about food photography that it became a job.

4. Do Kenyans have a national dish? If not, do you think there is need for one?

I think our national dish is good nyama choma, kachumbari and ugali. Chapati and beef or dengu stew, or ugali and sukuma wiki would also be somewhere on the list of most frequently consumed foods. So I chose chapati and beef stew even if it is more of an Indian dish.

5. What is the greatest book you have ever read?

Do cookery books count? I don't really read for pleasure. I prefer educational and self-development books. I am currently reading The Science of Cooking by Dr Stuart Farrimond because as a self-taught chef, I am constantly learning new things in my journey. I am also reading Blow the Lid Off by Robert Belle so that I can better master my creativity.

"
Abigail Arunga,"Kiko Enjani is a writer, artist and coder. You can find her work on https://bit.ly/kikosite.

1. How does writing, coding and artistry relate with each other?

You need to engage different parts of the brain to create codes and write fiction, but both call for creativity. Design is of paramount importance when creating art, and I often incorporate my designs into the visual presentation of my codes. Three-way symbiosis. The more I do of one, the better I get at the other two.

2. How much of your writing work do you post on the website?

 There's actually a lot on the site, but the content can only be retrieved by me. Currently, there are just three e-books and one letter which are available to the public, but there are seven more e-books and about 12 letters that only I can access. This is because I have to plan and rework some ideas and articles before publishing them.

3. What do you mostly write about?

About fictional worlds where characters are just trying to survive. I like creating new worlds and this forms a huge part of my prose, although I usually end up deleting most of it because my readers are not that patient with long reads.  Whenever I start going into detail, I usually dive really deep, describing things like the width of the tiles in every room, the precise length of a corridor, the way humans organise their institutions, and the timetables in a school that no one even goes to.

4. How did you get into coding? What do you love about it?

The first time I interacted with coding was when I was in primary school playing a game called ""Logo"", where you use mathematical symbols and instructions to move a tortoise across a screen. I must have been eight years old. Later, in university, I took an undergraduate course in information technology, majoring in programming.

5. How do you handle anxiety and writers’ block?

I can't write when worried about finances, or if there's external upheaval such as post-election violence or crime. If I code or design a logo and get paid enough, then I find it easy to write. I get worried about selling my content because my audience is so diverse. I don't know what they'd like to read. At the same time, they probably like my work because it's unique. It can be confusing. My strategy is to just release content that is of good quality, make it as accessible as possible to the public and see what happens."
Abigail Arunga,"Breaking News: The Beyond Zero Marathon does nothing for mothers.

Ok, not. Let me correct that statement because it is so clearly wrong.

The Beyond Zero Marathon does one thing for one particular mother, which is, provide useful PR when people ask what her office is for and how it is contributing to Kenya.
Ok, that statement might be wrong as well. The Beyond Zero Marathon, also does something for mothers who want to feel like they’re doing something for other mothers, without actually checking the statistics of how many marathons have been run and where all the money is going. But they run anyway.

Third time’s the lucky definition, I think. Because even after all that running, there are about a handful of respected mothers in your nation who benefit from these mythical undersupplied clinics spread across Kenya – and the one who gave birth outside Pumwani Hospital is not one of them.

I say mythical because I have never seen or heard of one functioning in real time – much like the testing for Covid-19 and the falling curve, these clinics remain something to read about in fantasy novels. But don’t take my word for it, of course, I’m heavily biased towards only what I see in my circles and environs. Surely there must be someone who got the first round of drugs when the hype was still heavy in the air, right? Surely this isn’t all for nothing? Surely all the money didn’t just…disappear?

You know what, in all honesty, we can’t blame this on the First Lady. Her blame lies in continuing to perpetuate the fallacy, not in its actual creation. As most problems in Kenya are, this one too is systemic. Our systems are business minded – oh, I misspoke again – our systems are thievery and capitalism minded (same thing), and so, the bare humanity that is required to let a woman who is very clearly giving birth into a hospital to receive medical care that she so urgently needs – for free, if our government is to be believed – is deeply, sadly, grossly lacking.

No one at Pumwani cared that this woman was giving birth outside on the roadside, until the cameras were turned on her. And shame on every individual who thought that was a good idea, who thought that it is okay to turn her away, for whatever reason. Whoever gave the guards that misguided authority should be tarred and feathered. This inclines me to believe that this has happened before, and when there were no cameras, it was allowed to continue. And despite what you read in the papers about respecting a mother last week, no one really cares about the mothers who are not incredibly rich and can’t fund your electoral campaign – not even Esther Passaris, as dramatic as she may be about it. That too is for the cameras. No one cares about mothers, or maternal healthcare – certainly not the women politicians who went, carrying nine basins for one woman and pads, for a photo opportunity, and certainly not the marathon that claims to help people like her; and not the politicians who make these laws knowing fully well that no one will bother to implement them.

I’ve misspoken again. The only person who cares for your mother is you. Don’t let these loud-mouthed headlines tell you any different. Once again, Kenyans, we’re on our own.

"
Abigail Arunga,"We’ve been in the throes of Covid-19 since March 13. Ish, no one is really keeping track anymore in what feels like a long night that has gone on too long. We’ve slipped into that phase where really, regardless of what the president says, there is still no vaccine, and so life can never really go back to normal. Not this year, anyway. Not for a while.

And yet, somehow, the Kenyan government claims to continue to protect its citizens against this global scourge. Do you feel protected? I certainly don’t. The government made a host of promises at the beginning of this pandemic, as it is wont to do – we will give out masks and sanitisers en masse, was one. Clearly their definition of en masse was in one highly publicised distribution that ended in a stampede and television time. We are doing everything we can to combat this disease and help the citizenry! Everything except have enough tests, provide organised quarantine, give clear regulations, put the police in check, listen to our pleas about police brutality, keep the airports closed down, direct landlords to ease the rent burden, reduce fuel prices…even reducing fuel prices, they could not do, and when they did it, it was a mistake that they quickly remedied the next month.

We are looking out for businesses, they said – all the while taking money out of the pockets of small business owners by inflating test prices (and regularly commanding checks and regulations that the politicians themselves don’t do, not in their homes, and certainly not at their rallies). We are bringing down taxes and loans, and helping the common man – while making no provision for the common man to survive.

Which begs the question, who is this curfew for? Nairobi County senator, Johnstone Sakaja, was given a slap on the wrist for his miscreancy – a very public slap, which he has now resorted to making jokes about on Twitter. That’s all well and good, but Senator Sakaja is not suffering, and has not suffered. The government seems to be in the throes of a budding election season, and they’re not obeying any of the Ministry of Health regulations, or those of the World Health Organization, or anyone else’s, but their own. So this curfew is not for politicians. If anything, the government is massively, grossly, benefiting from this virus, if recent news specials are to be believed.

Is the curfew for the common man? How, when the common man wants it lifted? Is it supposed to protect us from ourselves? How will a curfew protect us from ourselves if nothing else the government is doing is geared to do so?

No, the curfew isn’t for us. Is it to reduce crime, so that the police have a lighter load? Maybe. Considering the fact that there was a time that the police had killed more people than the virus, it would appear that the police will do what they were going to do regardless. So maybe this curfew is to protect us from the police – because that’s one of the only options that makes sense to me. We’re supposed to be protected from them.

There are already reports of the curve flattening – I didn’t believe the numbers that were being rolled out at the beginning that whipped us into a frenzy of panic, and I don’t believe these numbers now. But, a supposed flattening curve means growth for an economy, and accessibility to more international money to help us get to the ideal vaccine period. The ruse is up. We have to look like we are getting better at dealing with Covid-19 (of course we are) so that we can get more money from the IMF, and Japan, and whoever was in the newspaper last week (which of course we will). No one really cares about the reality on the ground. Not the people standing behind mics and starting their manifesto nonsense and shaking hands, anyway. The ruse is up – and curfew should be over, too. Because there’s really nothing it is doing. "
Abigail Arunga,"It’s dark outside and no one can really hear you cry. You don’t even know you’re crying until the sharp weight on your chest makes you sit up, and a tear rolls down your cheek. Fucking period. But you know it’s not the fucking period. It’s the man next to you. You hold your chest, as if you can stop the heaving. Maybe, this time. It won’t stop until you fall asleep, too tired to weep more, and the sun awakens to dry your wet pillow and herald another day when you’re wading through life, silently screaming in disbelief, wondering how you got here and why you can’t get out. 2 It isn’t that he’s particularly tall or spectacularly charismatic. You don’t really see him through the cloud of your sorrow until the compulsory staff team building, which of course you tried to avoid. He’s that type. Unassuming. Doesn’t say much. In other words…not your type. You’ve always liked the loud flashy ones, which is what got you into trouble in the first place. Lost in yourself, you don’t notice when employees are paired up for an exercise until he pulls you a chair. He sees the confused look on your face and smiles. ‘You don’t have to pay attention. I can write if you want.’ You smile back, vaguely, grateful that you can retreat. And he becomes that ambiguous space for you, where now, instead of silently screaming, you can just silently, be.   3 Now, you’re just reveling in having an excuse to not go home. You’re using him as an escape. He doesn’t mind, so you don’t stop. The first day he asks you to coffee after work, you know that home will just be more darkness. And so, to put it off, you stay in the sun. It’s a quiet cafe, in a quiet corner of an abrasive city; much like him. He doesn’t make small talk, because you both hate that. In fact, he takes out a book from his laptop bag. Then takes out another and hands it to you. ‘It seemed like something you’d like.’ That is his only explanation. He has no idea what you would like. You don’t tell him that he’s blessedly wrong. But for the first time, you feel freer than you’ve felt in forever. Later, when your head is being banged against a mirror and you feel a shard of clear glass cutting far too close to your eye, and you listen to him call you a whore, a whore who meets men in cafes because she’s too fancy now, you decide to die. "
Abigail Arunga,"There is no other way to put this, other than to say it. Kenya hates women.

And while this seems like a broad, general statement, it is only so because it's true.

And it is not just adult women, but also girls.

How do I know this, you ask? There are a number of ways to tell.

For one thing, every time something is suggested to help girls, or women, someone else shuts it down. There are literally hundreds of examples of this, everywhere.

For example, when Njoki Ndung'u proposed and pushed for the Sexual Offenses Act, at great personal and professional cost, the hordes that were against her were baying for her blood - all because she wanted to make sure that when a woman or a girl is sexually assaulted, there is justice against her abuser.

And when a woman is assaulted, which happens far too often for anyone to be comfortable, men and society at large still ask stupid questions like what was she wearing.

When women took to the streets to march for My Dress My Choice, a male public figure paid for a counter march to make the women marching feel unsafe as they protested - to the point that they split the march in half to try keep safe.

When a female policy maker stands up to say anything or support anything, the 'sins' of her past or lifestyle choices are often brought to harsh and unforgiving light - regardless of the fact that male parliamentarians have the exact same, if not murkier, records.

When our legislature is debating about whether there should be a tax on sanitary products and contraceptive options, the addition of monies is automatic - unlike, say, for free government condoms. It feels a lot like everything that is meant for women is met with far too much hostility - again, regardless of the fact that development in a country is directly measured against how its women are doing, regardless of the fact that we are more, work more, do more and still get paid less for counted and uncounted labour, including but not limited to the mental and manual load of running households, raising children, and somehow avoiding groping hands in - let's be honest, many - workplaces, a strenuous exercise in itself.

But for me, there is nowhere more clear that we are considered second class citizens than in the corridors of power.

There is a Bill being brought forward by Senator Susan Kihika, one that has already been smeared as pro-abortion. The opposers of this proposed law claim that medical officers will be allowed to perform abortions on young girls at will. But the opposers refuse to pay attention to the important hard facts. One, we lack comprehensive sex education in our schools. It is immediately apparent through our children, and even in the adults who are raising them.

Simple information like, how does the reproductive system work, where can you get condoms, how are babies made - turn grown adults into stammering embarrassments. They cannot explain it to themselves, much less to the children asking these questions.

They pass the buck to teachers, who throw the ball back to parents, and the cycle of misinformation of 'uliza mama yako' and 'that's not for children' continues. This is part of the reason why, during coronavirus, rates for teenage pregnancies and assaults have shot so high across the country.

Our young girls don't know what they're doing, or they don't fully understand the consequences of their actions; and the same goes for young boys. Knowledge is supposed to empower, but these kids are walking around in the dark.

Two, our Constitution already allows for abortion. The Bill is not pushing for things that do not already exist, except for implementation of awareness and spreading of knowledge. The Constitution provides for abortion if the life of the mother is at risk.

Three, it is abhorrent to me that the people who are against this Bill are mostly people who cannot engage with it at all on a realistic and pragmatic level; people who are hampered by their sex, ignorance or misguided religion.

They are either men, who have never really had to make life changing reproductive health decisions, or pseudo-religious people who lack compassion and empathy, walking around touting abstinence as a solid and workable solution to comprehensive sexual education in, yes, 2020.

News flash, it isn't. And, it is entirely possible to have information about sex without having sex, is it not? Don't clergy supposedly do that all the time, or is that a lie too? We cannot continue to ignore the realities: realities like there has been a 93 percent surge in teen pregnancies. Realities like 49 percent of pregnancies in Kenya are unplanned.

Our government is not willing to plan for its people, either - it isn't like Kenya has enough food for Kenyans, or shelter, or even tests and masks for Covid-19.

Our legislature continues to ignore said realities at the peril of, largely, young women and girls.

Truth be told, abortion are actually a small part of this Bill. And here's another fact: whether abortions are legal or not, they will happen, in backstreets, across borders, through traditional means, whatever we have to do to protect our futures and take back control of what should already be intrinsically ours - our human right to decide what to do with or own uteruses, whether it is agreed on or not.

The real question is, if these people actually care about us, they should care about if we actually do it safely, in a proper health facility, or bleeding out in a back alley somewhere with no support whatsoever.

So I ask: do they actually care about the girl child, or do they care that the girl child is doing what they want? "
Abigail Arunga,"1. Tell us about Concert Nyumbani…

This is a TV musical I created. In it, we use music and poetry to celebrate and appreciate some of the heroes who have emerged during the Covid-19 pandemic.

The show was sponsored by the Kenya Film Commission and involved four production houses and more than 50 filmmakers. It aired on July 19 across 11 local TV stations.

2. Between employment and entrepreneurship, which is easier for you?

I don't know if it is possible to differentiate the two. I think it depends on the profession in question. I know for a fact that my entrepreneurship activities are much more gruelling than any eight-to-five job I’ve ever held. My days begins at 4am, and I put in 14-hour shifts daily.

3. Why then did you choose entrepreneurship over employment?

Before I studied television production at USIU (United States International University), I was already working in the industry, doing odd jobs such as boom swinging.

The college degree just made me a professional in what I was already doing. I got into business because I wanted to own the ladder, not climb it.

4. What prompted you to create the Sol Family reality show?

Two years ago, I created the first celebrity reality show in the region - Being Bahati - and it was quite successful. After that, my team was eager to do a bigger and better show.
At the beginning of 2020, Sauti Sol, through one of their managers, approached me for a discussion about working with them for another reality TV show.

I have always been a big fan of Sauti Sol and I even went to school with Bien so I had no second thoughts at all. Besides, they are the biggest music band in Africa. I felt honoured to work with them and their team.

5. Why do you think it is so important to tell African stories through film?

There have been several complaints about how Africans are presented in foreign films and books, but if you think about it, it is not the responsibility of non-Africans to tell the African story. That should be our responsibility as indigenous Africans.

My company takes great pride in telling positive African stories, and we hope to spread this attitude all over the world.

"
Abigail Arunga,"We’re all pretty scared of Covid-19 right now, aren’t we? Every single cough is a possible disease. Every cold cannot just be a cold – no, for sure, that’s one of the immediate signs (regardless of the fact that we are currently in a very odd weather-shifting cold season, which is bound to produce more colds). 

We all think we have it, until we don’t.

And then we do.

Last week, I had to get a coronavirus test done, and it was one of the scariest things I’ve done this year. I’m not the type who goes to hospital often – outside of my regular root canals and mild anaemia, and the gynaecological visits that come with womanhood, I don’t really have anything out of the ordinary that would require entry into the ICU. 

So when a friend of mine tested positive, and I had been in close contact with them, I knew I had to get the test done, and the Ministry of Health was (surprisingly) going to follow up to make sure I did.

I didn’t think I actually had Covid-19. It’s like when you are going to get tested for HIV in university, and you now you probably don’t have it -- you haven’t had any blood transfusions lately, or unprotected sex -- but you still panic. 

As soon as they told me they had tested positive, I began to feel sick. Immediately. 

I had a fever and my throat started acting up. Was my body just being dramatic, or was this the beginning? I would find out the next day.

The place I went to did both a throat swab and a nose swab, for better reading of the tests – sensitivity, they called it. None of those words reassured me. 

When I saw how long the thing they wanted to put in my nose was, I felt sure that they were doing a brain swab. 

But in they went, through my nostrils – an uncomfortable, tickling feeling, as if the back of your throat is itching, but in your nose – and another one in my throat, to swab that uvula Cardi B speaks of. 

It wasn’t as bad as I thought. The discomfort wasn’t too much, and definitely not too much for peace of mind.

But that’s the thing, isn’t it. It is as bad as it is going to be, and it is going to get worse, especially with how many people are stealing the money that is supposed to be used for these tests.

I had a private test done – when I asked the clinician how people would be able to afford this, he said people are doomed. 

And there is no vaccine, and no PPEs, and really, not a lot of contact tracing going on. 

We don’t know enough about this thing, except that most people are going to get it, and it’ll kill a number as well. 

The WHO constantly changes the parameters of incubation and care. Some countries and cities, including Wuhan, are already having open-air concerts. Good for them.

Kenya, meanwhile, is making billionaires from Covid-19 funds and opening up airports. Our government has basically said that healthcare, much like security, depends on us. For the sake of those around us, we must start to talk about being positive or going for tests, without stigma. If no one is taking care of us, then we must take care of each other. 

Don’t not wear masks willy-nilly – we don’t have the healthcare infrastructure to support your carelessness. 

Don’t be embarrassed to admit that you went for a test – it’s important to talk about and normalise coronavirus conversations, so that we are all making informed decisions. 

Stay home if you can – outside is much, much worse, regardless of how other Kenyans are getting on. Let’s get used to this virus being around, because we have about another two years to go, and we’re probably going to have to try our best to remain conscientious to the best of our abilities.

I tested negative for Covid-19 this time, but I’m sure, much like its cousin the flu, it’ll get to me eventually. 

After all, your results are only valid the second you get them, right? "
Abigail Arunga,"Mutua Matheka is an internationally recognised photographer, traveller and all-around cool guy whose work has been showcased all over the world, including, most recently, on Beyoncé’s (yes, that Beyoncé) website. He spoke to Life&Style. 

Do you think school actually prepares you for a career as a creative, or in art?

Absolutely not. As a photographer, I don’t think photography school will make you a better photographer. Not in the way I think school is supposed to, anyway. Now that I am a photographer, I would go back to school because I know I am not going to go back to learn how to take pictures.

I am going back to learn about the history of photography, movement in photography – yes, based on white systems and white history, but that would be interesting to me now as well, in theory. Fortunately, or unfortunately, I am really anti being told what to do and when to do it. Have you always been anti being told what to do and when to do it?

I can’t remember the first instance of when I started being like this, but growing up, I’d always been against being told what to do. Not because I won’t do it. I will do the thing you want me to do. But more because it is not what I want to do right now. You understand? I understand that you (i.e. my mother, for example) want me to do it now because you require obedience from me, but know that I love and respect you. Still, I don’t want to do this thing right now. In a half-hour, I will do it.

And then you went to campus, being this guy, and did architecture. What is it with architects who don’t become architects? You, Nameless, Dela, Osborne Macharia…

Creatively, there is no academic discipline that makes you an overall excellent creative, like architecture. When you study it, you discover that it is a good segue into many things. The first year is basically a fine art class. We drew so much – and people had to learn to draw things without using rulers. You would think architecture is about using rulers, right? Not first year. We would be taken to town and told, draw the old parliament building. Left there for the whole lesson. You would be learning how to translate what you see, then draw it, to scale, and basically translate what you see into something that makes sense, or was communicating – without having yet touched a single tool. Your tools were your hands and your brain. And isn’t that what art is? Then, also, the degree takes six years. That teaches you long-suffering, which is essential in business. Then, we had hours of critique sessions – also crucial for an artist. Was there something that you finished school and said you would never do? Like, I don’t know, wake up early or something?

 Wash my own clothes. My mother made me wash my own clothes from when I was in Class Five because that’s a lesson she wanted to teach me at the time. We had a househelp, but the househelp was for her. So the help would wash mom’s clothes, and I would be there next to her, washing mine. I went to boarding school in Class Seven. We were not rich, so I didn’t have ati seven shirts – I had two, which meant I was washing shirts every day. The first day I found out what a mama fua was, on the first day of campus, I said never again. And I never looked back. When I met my wife, she initially wanted to wash clothes, even though I had clearly said that it would not make me like her more or less or make her more wife material or anything like that. She didn’t listen and tried one time. She too said never again – after that one time.

And these experiences brought you here, from being in architecture school to being featured on Beyoncé’s website. How do you even explain that?

It’s inexplicable. Some of what is my life now is not what I imagined, not even what I could have imagined. Even when I imagined being a really dope architect when I was employed, 10 years ago, I would have never imagined that I would go to the places I go to now, ati because of taking pictures. Even now, I get shocked. Mainly because I don’t consider myself the best photographer or anything, I do think my work is good. I don’t think you can be the best artist, you know, because that’s like saying you can compare two artists, and what can that honestly even be based on? 

Till now, I’m like, ok this is nice. Still, when I think about it, really, this is what it means: it means that there was someone in this world somewhere who said, we need to feature a Kenyan photographer on the website, for the curation section, and then someone else said, yes, I know someone. And then they sat down, I assume, and looked at my work, and they said, I hope, that yes, this is the one, we definitely have to have this person on here. That’s so wild to me! 

And yet even though you operate outside the system of the norm, there is a lot that you do that is very much still operating within the system of the industry, or whatever you want to call it, right? Do you think as a person, as an artist, it is possible to operate out of the system, of capitalism, or systems like it?

I think it’s possible, but you have to be one of those people who are down for whatever. You can choose to operate outside the system of things but that also comes with its disadvantages here and there which you have to be ready for.

Like having to farm, for example?

Yeah. Dealing with things not going the way you want them to. If you don’t know how to deal with those things, you might get shocked.

Just to briefly return to the Beyoncé question, and how you kind of would never have even thought to work with her…

I have never even thought of Beyoncé to work with, and not because I wouldn’t. Still, because I would love to create some really cool stuff - but I’ve never even thought about that as a possibility. It seems like something so far away; you know? Like sometimes my mind thinks about things like I will get this grand idea, and then I start thinking about how it would be possible…and then I get tired. I am very good at thinking up big thoughts. And stopping there. If that was my job, I would be so successful! But the minute I have to find the small pieces to move and manage for the big ideas to happen, I stop immediately.

But somehow you managed to make the big idea of your career happen.

How it happened was that I started out as an interior architect after I graduated. I actually picked up employment and picked up a camera at the same time. But one won.

And it wasn’t even that I hated my job or my boss. I had an excellent job. I did work that was meaningful to me. I had a huge responsibility to design things and see them built. I did things that I loved to do. I quit because, the job did not have space for my photography. And ironically, I still ended up having a job [that goes against what I said earlier about hating to be told] - being told where to be, and at what time. 

I remember when I was leaving, I tried to tell my boss that they actually only needed me for two days a week, total. If she had allowed me to do this, I might still be employed!

How exactly did you quit? And when?

Many things happened in 2010. I wasn’t using my camera much. Then I got married. Then I was like, I bought this camera. It cost money. Let me use it. I started shooting every day. I was just working and shooting and working and shooting. I would sleep three hours a day: Wake up at 6 am, leave the house at 6:30 am, be in the office by 7:15, then I would be online, posting the ‘pic of the day’ that I took the day before. I would have coffee at my desk at 8:30. During lunch, I would take my camera, walk around and try to find pictures for that day’s assignment. If I didn’t find a picture, I would come back and eat lunch at my desk. I’d head home at 5 pm and have a portrait session from 6:30 pm – form people who used to see my work from the pic of the day segments. At 8, we’d eat, I’d hang out with my wife, we watch some TV, she would go to bed at 10 pm. I’d tuck her in, get back on my computer and work till 2 am.

So picking one job was about survival. I was either going to quit my job or quit photography. Or do photography over the weekend like an average person! So I went to my job and asked my boss for a compromise – I work for half a month for half the pay, and then decide in three months whether I was going to stay or not.

 My wife has never been the type of person to stand in the way of anything I want to do. Up to today, she’s the, we’ll figure it out, kind of person. And I think that’s because we would like our marriage to be the type where people are free to do what they want. For instance – she’s a sign language interpreter, and she really loves working with deaf people, and with children. And we all know in Kenya those jobs don’t pay well because people don’t consider them essential. So I said, since this is what you really like to do, I’ll try to work to make sure that I can support your lifestyle, of giving back to people. 

The jobs kept coming somehow. That first year was outstanding. I was even like, I thought people said that this would be really rough? The roughness came, by the way. Just later.

When was it rough?

2019 was the roughest year. I did one job.

How did you survive? Are you like, a mad saver?

I don’t believe in saving; actually, I can’t save for a future I don’t know about.

I did a huge job with Hennessy, and I was on a billboard. That contract was around the end of 2018, so literally, that money paid for life through to 2019. And I opened my print shop and started selling prints and doing my prints on tees, out of necessity. If I wasn’t broke, I wouldn’t have done it.

What is broke to you?

When I have less than Sh5,000.

5k? He ok, but brokeness is different when you’re a parent.

Funny enough, I’ve never been worried about the children and what they will eat. It’s somehow never gotten there. There’ll always be a ka-rice. I’ve had a friend give me 5kgs of rice after asking if we have food. You eat rice with beans somewhere. You can’t miss beans if you look inside in the corner somewhere! My broke, at least, has people around me who can hold me when the line is slacking. And sometimes I can do the same. The kind of people who you can tell each other, listen, I need 10k, and I don’t know when I’ll pay you back.

How are you feeling about Covid-19?

It’s just freelancing every day. The whole world is living the way creatives usually live. It makes me feel like maybe if people paid us better and faster, we’d be ok [through Corona]. Because usually it takes people sijui eight years to pay...

What are you most grateful for, in this moment?

Honestly – I think I’m really grateful for this talent. It’s never lost on me how I feel my life would be so different if I didn’t have what I do. And it isn’t the doing in itself, it’s just what it makes me feel, to do the work that I do, when people receive it when I access doors that I would never have thought would open for me."
Abigail Arunga,"If a Fast and Furious movie is what you want; a Fast and Furious film is what you'll get. 

I finally got round to watching Hobbs and Shaw and let me tell you Maina it was everything that I thought it was going to be. What I'm saying is, if you're going into a Fast and Furious movie expecting depth as opposed to a suspension of belief, then you're in the wrong place.

The story is, the Rock and Statham are two of the most excellent world savers in the world, and are thus called upon to save the world from a deadly virus that can be used for biological warfare. It sounds like every other James Bond slash Bourne Supremacy plot, right? (remember when Fast and Furious was about cars?)

But what they did was turn it into a fantasy movie - which it already was, with all the stunts and stuff. But like, a level higher.

Spoilers start here:

If I'm frank with you, I watched this movie because The Rock and Idris Elba are in it, mainly. Drool-worthy factors apply. About an hour in (Yo, this movie is two and a half hours long!) I felt like I had sold all reasoning in my body for entertainment purposes. There was no rhyme and reason to the sequence of shoddily thrown together events. The alpha male banter between Rock and Statham was so tiring. The apparent effects were over the top - the real reason we are here, I suppose - and the number of times the Rock said brother should be turned into a drinking game. In real life, or rather, in real movie life, no one is sitting through that. But that's why the movies are made, right?
Watch it if you have two and a half hours of your life to look at sculpted bodies fighting Idris Elba after a building has dropped on his head and he still has a perfect face. "
Abigail Arunga,"The president has decided to wage war on rapists. 

That’s what this headline would have looked like had he issued a different directive last week.

In case you missed it, President Uhuru Kenyatta recently ordered county commissioners to carry out a nationwide crackdown on private clinics offering emergency contraceptives to underage girls.

In my opinion, the wording of the order is very problematic. It could end up having an effect opposite to what was intended: it could punish girls and protect rapists instead.

If Mr Kenyatta really wants to help underage girls targeted by sex pests, he should order the police to arrest rapists in the towns where numbers of teenage pregnancies have gone up.

He should also consult the Ministry of Gender to come up with a plan on the best way to ensure that these survivors of rape have access to medicine and psychological support. 

He should also consult the experts on what measures should be put in place that ensure that these girls are not forced to stay in abusive homes. As a bonus, he could also publicly castigate leaders like the Embu Governor who recently said that wives should wear school uniforms to reduce instances of child rape in the county.

Directives issued by his administration should demonstrate a greater level of care to these girls. They need to feel that the authorities care about their welfare when they are abused.

More understanding and thought should go towards figuring out exactly why underage girls are getting contraceptives from these clinics. At the end of the day, at the crux of this matter is the failing of the system of education in Kenya, as well as our social ineptitude to teach and train children, to understand what is and is not right, and to arm them with what they need to go into the world. 

The white man’s inherited religion has somehow convinced us that sex, and doing it, and talking about it, and educating people on it, is bad – completely opposite of our African tradition. And so, when someone goes through 8-4-4, they do not have the tools or the language to understand consent. 

They do not understand that having sex with a minor is wrong. They do not understand that these things should be reported. No, instead they grow up thinking that rape is the fault of whatever garment of clothing a young innocent girl was wearing. 

They grow up thinking that emergency contraception is a symptom of a careless sexual lifestyle, as opposed to a very real life saving drug. 

They grow up to lack empathy and police, rather than protect, a very vulnerable segment of our population.

"
Abigail Arunga,"Martha Nasipwondi Wakoli is an electrical engineer and founder of the free magazine Queengineers. She has worked for Rift Valley Railways, Kenya Power and Virunga Power.

What does Nasipwondi mean?

Nasipwondi means born during sweet potato season. Lipwoni is singular, mapwoni is plural, for sweet potatoes. But I wasn’t even born then, I inherited my paternal grandmother’s name, you know, the way nomenclature is done in African families.

Do you think your name has had an effect on your life? In that how Africans name their children and then the children inhabit the qualities of the person they are named.

I mean, I wouldn’t say all of Africa…let’s see, my grandmother was nice, so I would be lying if I said yes. Ha! She was nice and not rude. To be fair, I didn’t spend enough time with her. She died when I was small, so it is hard to know. I grew up in Nairobi, she lived in Bungoma, where we went to visit every five years, so it is hard to know. Me I don’t know, what characteristics do sweet potatoes have?

Haha, of course. So is it growing up in Nairobi that made you want to become an engineer?

My father taught engineering at UoN for the longest time. When he went to school, UoN was the only place that offered engineering, same way you had to go to a certain university for Medicine, like Makerere, and Dar es Salaam for Law, was it? I was raised in Nairobi, because my parents moved here for university, and then taught it here. We grew up with engineers – my dad, my uncles, their friends. My brother is a mechanical engineer. It is what I knew, earliest.

And what made you decide on your particular discipline?

I didn’t know enough about engineering, actually, to be sure what I wanted to do. I was good at Math and Physics, and I was certain that I didn’t want to do civil engineering. Structures don’t interest me – concrete, buildings, roads, they don’t interest me. I don’t care for houses! And I knew a little bit about civil engineering from one of my superstar uncles. So it was a coin toss between mechanical engineering and electrical engineering. Now machines, machines interest me. My brother had already told me what mechanical engineering was about when he was in school (he’s eight years older than me) so I was like let me do the other one, the option, then we can be a super team. Note, we’re not a super team!

How did you end up working for Kenya Power?

I actually just applied for the work. Kenya Power advertises for graduate engineers every so often, so in 2015, I applied and interviewed and got the job.

I think I speak for most Kenyans when I ask – why Kenya Power?

Because Kenya Power are the only organisation that you can work for and get training in power systems at. The reality in a country like Kenya where distribution of electricity is heavily monopolised is, that the only place you can learn about power systems is the only place that is doing it. There’s no one who loosely has power systems in their house that you can apprentice off of.

Power systems are my specialisation, basically – I am interested in that particular sector. My undergraduate degree was in Heavy Current Electrical Engineering, and then my Masters is in Energy and Sustainability and Electrical Power Engineering. I work on electricity generation, distribution, power lines, things like that. And I am very interested in having more Africans having more electricity, cheaply.

Not to be reductive, but, why should people have power?

Because it is a basic need. It reduces the amount of time that people need to do basic tasks, and higher level things. It’s on the same level, for me, as having water, or having clean toilets. It shouldn’t be an elitist thing, and cost more if you live far, or have more money. It is a basic need.

Then what happened after Kenya Power?

Like I said, I am interested in people having electricity. Kenya Power is focused on urban and peri-urban areas, which means many rural areas are still far removed from the grid. So in the last couple of years, policies, specifically within the energy sector, have allowed increased participation of the private sector for electrification in rural areas. I decided I wanted an opportunity to do more work in rural electrification. The company I joined is attempting to do so.

And somewhere along that path, Queengineers happened?

No, no, Queengineers was before Kenya Power – because of my experience at Railways. I was the only female field engineer at Rift Valley Railways when I started working there in 2013. Working on trains was the coolest thing! But I didn’t have toilets. As in, there were no toilets for women in the field (Here’s a question - how do you menstruate without toilets? In the field?) This is because there was no one in the field - at all - who was female. There were no field engineers who were female, no female train drivers, no female technicians – in fact the only female electrical foreman – they still called her a foreman – in the company was in Eldoret – at least, when I worked there.

I know there are female engineers because I went to school with them. If you ask me, of course, I can give you a whole database. But there is just an obvious lack of representation of them. We are here. But no one is talking about it - or rather, no one is recognising our contribution. It’s kind of like how people say Africans don’t read – don’t say Africans don’t read, say YOU don’t read. Don’t say there are no female engineers, say you don’t know any.

The irony for me here was that the office itself was full of women – in finance, in human resources, but yet the women in human resources weren’t aware of this toilet thing in the field. That was in 2013 – I hope things have changed. Because it is a blind spot, clearly, even for women.

So the short (shorter?) answer to why I started Queengineers is, when I was doing mentorship in high schools, I was quite often the only female engineer these young girls had ever met. I wanted to document more engineers because I didn’t want them to have a singular perspective – my perspective – of what being an engineer meant. I wanted to provide a broader narrative – after all, being an engineer is just the work that I do. There is so much more to me, to us. We are people. We like other things.

It was to show girls that you can be another person. The schools I go to – like Kenya High, Loreto Limuru, Precious Blood, schools like that – there is a very real pressure to excel at all costs. And so the students I meet there ask me questions like, can I be an engineer if I am not number one in Math. I was never number one in Math! I get asked, I also like music, can I still do music. You know what they knew me for in Kenya High? Drama and Choir. Extra-curriculars are so important. We need to also allow young girls to be interested in more than one thing, and understand that that is not necessarily incongruous. I realize the privilege I have in saying so but even beyond this, we need to allow other girls to have this same privilege, which is a deeper systemic issue – we want girls to read, but there are no libraries, we want girls to get into STEM, but there are no labs. We want girls to be able to go to school and thrive but in this 2020 girls still have to buy sanitary towels or not go to school.

What I’m saying is, you can like singing, you can like writing, you can like tinkering. But you don’t have to only be a singer, or only a writer. You can like all of them and they can co-exist. You don’t have to be just the one thing. 

"
Abigail Arunga,"Crimes in this country are varied and sometimes unclear.

For example, it is a crime to steal but it matters what you steal. If you steal a chicken to feed your family, in all likelihood, you will get a couple of years in jail, or a hefty fine, which you probably can’t afford – because if you were stealing chicken to feed your family, then you definitely won’t be able to pay a fine for stealing the chicken that is more than the price of the chicken. Which it definitely is.

It is not a crime, however, to steal public funds, because, even if they track you down and list you in the paper, like the allegations against Anne Waiguru, for example, or the funds missing from the National Covid-19 fund for example, or the (insert literally any scandal here), the most that will happen is a much publicised court case after which you, the (now very rich) thief, will go home after, post playing Solitaire on your phone in full view of everyone who bothered to attend any mockery of proceedings. Either that, or you’ll be put up in a plush jail, which will be like wealthy house arrest, and then after you get out, you can run for president or open a church.

Speaking of a national Covid fund, it is illegal to be out in public without a mask (even if the government who said that these are compulsory are not providing folk with masks, and therefore it would appear that they don’t really care who dies. I say this because after all the literal billions of shillings we’ve gotten from World Bank et al specifically for Covid, you would think that we were spending more on people than daily press conferences and non-existent tests, but alas. See also: stealing a chicken in paragraph one). It is also illegal to be out past the 9 pm curfew. This is an offense punishable by death.

Ok, it is punishable by death, if you are poor. He, if you are poor in this country, you are dead. In case you didn’t know it, this is another varied and unclear crime in this country (see also: paragraph one).  If you are one of the watus, it’s over, and so is your life. If you can’t afford to grease the palm of the police who catch you, they’re throwing you in, manhandling you, and you will be lucky to leave alive. If you’re not driving a nice big shiny car, but you’re walking on the street, they’ll probably break your legs.

And oh, if you’re not Johnson Sakaja – well, you might as well roll over and die now. If you can’t take to Twitter and claim you did nothing – right after media announces that you were busted – because you are one of the millions of Kenyans not represented on KOT – then you are worthless to all deemed justice in this your own country.

If you, like Sakaja, earn about Sh1.4 million a month (plus luxury loan allowances and all that jazz), then you’re very lucky that you (and your chosen few) will pay a fine that is only  0.0107 per cent of your monthly salary (which is what you get when you divide his fine, Sh15,000, by Sh1.4 million).

Then you’ll resign from some silly board for how and expect Kenyans to accept and forget. Which we might. Because we’re honestly here trying to survive your Senate’s incompetence and global pandemic.

This country will beat you to death for the brokeness they create – and don’t you forget it. Stay in your house that you can’t pay rent for until they do the scheduled government evictions. These are your only choices. This is your senator."
Abigail Arunga,"1. How do festivals like the Mashariki Film Festival impact the Kenyan film industry?

Just being in the film industry is a challenge by itself. Getting the funds to make a film is so difficult! It is only recently that we've started seeing the government offering financial support to film makers. Even local competitions such as the Machawoods Festival were not really about performing arts.

So to be recognised outside my country, to have my film screened and people asking questions about it, boosted my confidence and made me feel appreciated. It was proof that my story is relatable even abroad. It is a sign that we can create content that is universal.

Films festivals give us the encouragement and energy to keep going.

2. Do you think the films regulatory board is playing its role effectively?

The fact that we have a censorship board in the first place confirms that we have come a long way. It means we are creating a lot of content, which is a good thing.

I think the Kenya Film Classification Board (KFCB) does what it is supposed to do. However, there is a difference between censorship and obstructing progress. There is a thin line between these two and KFCB needs to realise that art is a reflection of society.

3. Lately, there have been heated discussions online about how Kenyan artists are treated. Why now?

I believe those stories have always been there, and I believe there is a film renaissance of some sort happening in our country. We have witnessed an increase in the number of films being premiered, and the number of films made, and a consequent increase in the number of jobs created in the industry.

So now the cries for change are becoming louder, meaning that things are about to change.

4. How has Covid-19 affected your job?

I am a TV producer and production is all about team work, going to different locations, looking for different guests for my shows and selecting captivating topics. Coronavirus has made us all think outside the box and turn to technology to get work done! Most shows are now being filmed with the guests joining in from different locations. I guess it has showed us that we just have to identify the opportunities around us and seize them.

5. What is your favourite TV show of all time?

Grey's Anatomy. It amazes me how a TV series can be on for more than 10 years and still be as captivating and interesting as it is. The growth of the characters and plots is also quite commendable. "
Abigail Arunga,"1. Your Instagram bio says that you are a blogger, not a stylist. What is the difference?

A stylist only seeks to enhance other people’s appearances, whereas style blogging is about me knowing my personal style and working with or around it. Stylists can be dramatic or subtle depending on the script or set they need.

2. Tell us about Face of Kenya…

 It is a charity organisation that aims to help those who can’t afford to pay their school fees, especially women and girls who are trying to escape FGM. I help raise funds for that cause. I think it is important for fashion icons to be involved in such activities, but it is everyone's duty to be conscious of the less fortunate and be willing to create change because we need to build a better future for the next generation.

3. What clothes do you spend your days in nowadays?

I actually dress up a lot even during this time, but sometimes I wear just my dera! I recently shared on my Instagram page that wearing a dera with jeans underneath makes one look cute. I don't own a lot of lounge wear but I do own comfortable clothes such as slouchy jeans and culottes which I wear a lot when I’m at home.

4. Where do you shop, and how do you decide which stores to visit?

 I can shop anywhere, although I am cautious about the cost of items. One of my favorite stores, Marks and Spencer, has really nice, unique clothes but most people think they only cater to the older generation. Yet the shop has unique clothing items of very good quality because older people are more meticulous shoppers. When deciding what clothing items to buy, I usually consider timelessness and elegance.

5. What is the first thing you will do when this pandemic is over?

I will probably go swimming. But then, will swimming pools really be open? Can we maintain social distancing while swimming? Who knows? "
Abigail Arunga,"1. Who exactly is a sports psychologist? Why did you become one?

It involves therapy and counselling in matters sport. I studied psychology for my Bachelor’s degree and then I went to the UK to study sports psychology because the course isn’t available here in Kenya.

I chose this career because I was curious to know how athletes manage adversity. The mind of an athlete is so interesting. We tend to think of athletes as superheroes. When they win, we love them. When they lose, we hate them. Yet they have emotions.

I recently formed a sports and performance psychology consultancy with a friend (Kanyali Ilako). It is nice to have someone to walk with because there are not too many sports psychologists around.

2. What is the name of your consultancy?

Brain Frees. It focuses on sessions, therapy and workshops for athletes, coaches and referees. We recently launched two weeks of free therapy sessions for athletes to help them cope with the negative effects of the coronavirus pandemic.

3. Does this mean you actively watch and play sports?

Yes, I do. When I was in high school, I participated in swimming, hockey, football, and a little bit of basketball. I attend rugby matches regularly and I watch Formula One.

4. Why do you think female athletes are treated differently from their male counterparts?

There’s a lot more focus on men’s sports. In fact, putting such labels on the different teams conditions our minds to see them differently. Let’s just call it football, not women’s football. The media also focuses more on men’s sports and male athletes despite the fact women’s sports performances are just as exciting – sometimes even better – than men’s.

5. How can we remedy the rot within the Kenyan sports industry?

The problems afflicting the local sports industry are deeply embedded in the system. Sports is never given the attention it deserves. It is still treated as a hobby yet it is a multi-million dollar industry in other countries.

We need to nurture young talent and create an environment where they can grow. So many Kenyans have denounced their nationalities and went on to feature for other countries because they don’t feel appreciated back home. "
Abigail Arunga,"Glenfiddich whisky recently launched a brand new bottle design, the first of its kind in over 50 years. The online launch was heralded by influencers and partakers alike – but influencers got to taste one of mobile bar Revolver’s delightful cocktails in conjunction with the launch, known as a Speyside Sandcastle: Glenfiddich 12 Year, Cherry Liqueur, Sweet Vermouth and passion fruit juice. It was as delectable as it sounds. Welcome to the digital world, everyone, where drinking during the day at an online event is perfectly acceptable! The fine bottle, with a now more pronounced tround (I didn’t know what this was either, until Mulunda Kombo, their brand ambassador, explained that it was a combination of a circular and triangular shape – convenient for storing it under the bed so it wouldn’t roll out unannounced). Here’s everything you need to know about Glenfiddich, new bottle or not:

Glen means valley, and Fiddich is deer – and so the name of the whisky literally translates to the valley of the deer.
How to pronounce it, you ask? Glen – fidick. There is no ch. Or any other sound attached to the end.
The price of the whisky will not change, but the bottle is already being circulated, of course.
Glenfiddich whisky is distilled in the highlands of Scotland, and you should probably go visit the factory someday. For documentation’s sake, of course.
‘Slàinte mhath’ is the common toast used in Scotland where whisky is concerned, and it sounds nothing like how its spelt – I would advise you go online, or get a true Scotsman, to guide you along the lines of this pirate-like pronunciation.
They key to a wee dram (small tot) of whisky is to enjoy it, of course – but if you want to sound a bit fancy, weigh out the nose, taste, finish – what aromas you pick up when you swirl it around, what it tastes like to confirm what you thought you sensed and how smoothly it goes down (and how long it stays pleasantly at the back of your throat going down). I like a good whisky and I confirm that this bit is the best part."
Abigail Arunga,"We are told that thousands of young girls have gotten pregnant overnight in Kenya. There has been no mention of the other parties in the acts. Instead, the authority is blaming the society.

Here is a list of things that very intelligent people who are public figures have held responsible for the multiple rapes and teenage pregnancies currently happening in Machakos, and across Kenya.

Pornography, because children watching pornography try and practice it immediately, much like they try and act out action movies and shoot people, or see fantasy movies like Lord of the Rings and proceed to fly. This makes sense, and so the solution here, obviously, is to ban pornography, because the Kenyan government, in 2020, is in charge of the internet.
NGOs faking reports about these children being raped - faking them because they are pushing for the introduction of comprehensive sex education in schools. Everyone knows that comprehensive sex education is a terrible thing for the adult mind, and therefore those bad NGOs trying to spread evil in our school cannot be allowed. Children knowing about sex only leads to more sex, just like how children learning CRE leads to more gods, and learning English leads to new ‘Englishes’. Since what we have now is working so well, let us leave it at that.
Vulgar music. This is an obvious and immediate candidate, and in fact should have been put at number one. Listening to anything that goes against anything leads to everyone doing anything that they want! Studies prove that hearing music directly influences behaviour, because no one has agency and it is impossible to deny the sweet siren sound of 'Kuna Dawa.' As we know, all humans do exactly what music tells them, and therefore, regardless of the fact that we are trying to constantly take money from musicians, we must also now ban what we deem vulgar music is, because our systems are controlled enough to do so and the music industry in Kenya is very well regulated. Refer also to point number one on internet.
Here is an actual list of who is responsible for the rapes (spoiler alert: It is not the teenagers being raped, or the music, or the Internet, or NGOs).
It is the rapists.

But it is also the rape culture that we live in, where everyone points a finger at literally anyone and everyone except the criminals who commit the crime.
So yes, Magoha and Mutua are partially to blame for the fact that instead of condemning criminals, they perpetuate rape culture and divert the argument into pointless sideshows like banning internet.

Ironic, isn't it? "
Abigail Arunga,"Sharon Nderitu, aka Shazz, wears many hats proudly. She is a stand-up comedian, an interior designer, mathematics teacher, curvy fashion model, a blogger, an artist and video-vixen.

Last year, she climbed Mt Kilimanjaro, but don’t ask her about it because you’ll never hear the end of it!

She has played in several theatrical productions, most recently as part of the cast of Kambi Gathesha’s play, Decalage and The Vagina Monologues.

1. How do you find time to do so much?

Indeed I wear many hats, but I usually wear the one that fits the occasion. Sometimes I wear a sombrero, a Women’s Guild kitambaa or a baseball cap. I am quite adventurous. If I have the slightest interest in something, I won’t hesitate to jump on it. I have been fortunate that some of my blind leaps have been very rewarding, such as plus size modelling and stand-up comedy.

2. Why do some people have a love-hate relationship with curvy girls?

Author Ijeoma Umebinyuo says that you are not alive to please the aesthetic of the colonised eye. For too long, beauty has been defined by European ideals and has considered a very narrow band of physical features such as blonde hair, blue eyes and fair skin.

It is only recently that we have started seeing dark skinned men and women being portrayed as attractive - and even then, the bias is still skewed towards slim bodies. If there is no place for a black woman, there is definitely no place for a fat, black woman! And yet here we are.

Sometimes people try to silence plus size beauties by citing health concerns, but don’t we have a right to look good? Why should we be forced to “earn” it? It is ridiculous to suggest that because I am fat I should not be seen, should not wear certain colours and should not represent others who are like me.

3. Where can we find your comedy, and who is your fave standup comedian?

My comedy is best enjoyed live. I host a monthly comedy show called Linner with Shazz which is a celebration of comedy, music and conversations. I also perform in events organised by Spare My Ribs, Nairobi Comedy Club, Punchline Comedy, and Stand up collective.

I do not believe there are rules to comedy or that there should be. I like to encourage audiences to look for comedians who suit their particular taste. I deliberately never make any jokes about God. Faith is holy ground and I dare not to enter sacred ground with shoes on. My relationship with God, however, is a different story.

Locally, I have a special place in my heart for comedians who invited me into the comedy scene and gave me a platform, put me in their comedy shows and encouraged me such as Emmanuel Kisiangani, Mammito, Doug Mutai, Brian Onjoro, Ty Ngachira, Eric Lusava, Jason Runo, Amandeep Jagde, John Ribia, Justine Wanda, Ciku Waithaka, Maina Murumba, George Waweru & David Macharia. Internationally, I admire the works of Ak Dans (South Sudan) Long John (Zimbabwe) and Don Andre (Uganda).

4. Why did you climb Mt Kilimanjaro?

I climbed it because I had been offered a chance to, and I said yes before I figured out how I would do it. I am not a seasoned climber, but I wanted to confirm that I could climb the mountain despite my body size. I was careful not to share the adventure with too many people to avoid fat-phobic comments and questions such as, “utatoboa kweli, na vile umenona kunona?” My sister Terri has climbed more mountains than me, and she encouraged me to do it.

5. What do you think your role is in re-shaping Kenya?

Every time I think about politicians’ failed promises, I remember that I can do something. i can change my surroundings. I keep asking myself, are you fair to your colleagues? Are their wages fair? Are their working hours fair? Do you treat them with respect? There is a bible verse my parents taught me that says, “What does the Lord require of you? To act justly, and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God.""

"
Walter Menya,"Chief Justice David Maraga could be preparing for possibly his last major act before he retires early next year, with an imminent recommendation to President Uhuru Kenyatta to dissolve parliament for its failure to enact a law on gender balance.

Judiciary sources told the Sunday Nation that Mr Maraga could transmit his recommendation to the President mid this week after he received at least six petitions calling for the dissolution of parliament.

Mr Maraga will be retiring in January 2021.

Such a move, with huge constitutional and political ramifications, could only rank second to the decision by a majority of the Supreme Court judges which nullified the August 2017 presidential election result. The CJ was on the majority side, which invalidated President Kenyatta’s re-election and called for a repeat poll on October 26 which the opposition boycotted and Jubilee candidate won.

The CJ has petitions from the Law Society of Kenya, former Marakwet West MP David Sudi, Margaret Toili, Fredrick Mbugua, Bernhard Aoko and Stephen Owoko. They all argue that parliament has deliberately refused to enact the law. While plans for such a transmission are afoot, there is anxiety in the Judiciary that the CJ’s action could be misinterpreted in the current polarised political climate in the country. There are also questions as to whether President Kenyatta will act on the recommendation, given his past relationship with Mr Maraga and the judiciary.

The appointment of 41 people recommended by the Judicial Service Commission (JSC) as judges is still pending as President Kenyatta seeks an opening to have a greater say in the recruitment of judges. Budget constraints in the judiciary have increased.

“From a constitutional standpoint, once the Chief Justice transmits his recommendation, the President is bound to act, and the Constitution allows him to act in one way only. That is something that has serious constitutional, legal and political consequences and the President would need to consult far and wide, including with the political leadership. But as to whether this president can follow through on the CJ’s recommendation is another matter,” lawyer Nzamba Kitonga told the Sunday Nation.

According to Mr Kitonga, there is a likelihood that if the CJ’s recommendation comes to pass it will be challenged in court.

Saturday, neither Mr Maraga nor the Chief Registrar of the Judiciary Anne Amadi responded to the Sunday Nation’s queries. The enactment of the two-thirds gender principle was among the things parliament was to do within five years after the promulgation of the Constitution. Ten years down the line,, it hasn’t and  four attempts by the National Assembly were defeated.

The last attempt on February 27, 2019 failed after the proponents of the bill could not raise the requisite quorum of 233 MPs to vote. LSK in its petition of July 17, says parliament has contravened the Constitution “by neglecting, refusing, and/or failing to perform its constitutionally imposed obligation to realise the two-thirds gender rule.”

Mr Maraga met with the LSK Council and advised them to serve the Speakers of the Senate and National Assembly.

In their responses, the two clerks of the Houses Michael Sialai and Jeremiah Nyegenye opposed the petition, questioning the CJ’s jurisdiction to recommend the dissolution of parliament, adding that it is impracticable to enact the two-thirds gender principle. They said there is no clarity as to how a by-election would be held if parliament were dissolved under such circumstances.

LSK president Nelson Havi has accused the two clerks of “putting in sloppy responses,” leaving the CJ with a simple decision.

But dissolving parliament at this juncture means that President Kenyatta will have prematurely ended his final term in office two years early.. In a House as divided as Jubilee Party, the prospect of dissolving Parliament is a double-edged sword.

There are no timelines as to when the President should act on such a recommendation, though lawyer Nzamba Kitonga says that the courts have developed guidelines on ‘reasonable time’ where the Constitution has not provided one.  Such a recommendation could give the President yet another opportunity to deal with Jubilee MPs who have continuously defied him. "
Walter Menya,"The current accumulated pensions bill is estimated at Sh100 billion annually, and with the pending unprocessed applications and thousands others hitting or nearing retirement age, there is a real possibility of aggregate pensions clocking Sh159 billion in the next two years. What is the government’s policy to tame spiralling pensions bill? Could the government consider consolidating all pensions under the Retirements Regulatory Authority?
Elly Owiny Kotieno, Kisumu

The pension wage bill has continued to increase over the years and is projected to increase to over Sh100 billion in the current financial year, 2020/21. To ensure sustainability of the public service pension wage bill, the government is implementing pension reforms including harmonisation of pension policies for the public service and introduction of a contributory pension scheme for public servants. It is already work in progress. The government has gazetted January 1, 2021 to be the commencement date of the Public Service Superannuation Scheme (PSSS) Act. The employee and employer contribution will be at the rate of 7.5 per cent and 15 per cent of the basic salary respectively. This aims to bring under control the spiralling pension expenditure in the medium and long-term and free more resources for government development projects in other critical sectors of the economy.

The PSSS scheme covers teachers, civil servants and disciplined services (police, prison officers and NYS) and any other service that the Cabinet Secretary for the National Treasury determines as ‘public service’ for the purposes of the Act. The PSSS, like other Public Retirement Pension Schemes, is under the regulation of the Retirement Benefits Authority.

Can we trust the Cabinet that it means well for the country when it is fronting selfish agendas in these difficult times Kenyans are going through?
Ann Njoki Njung'e, Limuru

There are principles of governance that inform the conduct of public servants and these are clearly articulated in various Articles of the Constitution. Chapter Six on Leadership and Integrity prescribes the conduct of State officers and Chapter 9 Article 153 enumerates responsibility and accountability in Cabinet. Chapter 13 Article 232 covers principles and values of Public Service. There are checks to ensure integrity is at the core of conduct of all public officers.

The public service one-year internship programme that was started last year has now prepared its first batch of 3,100 inaugural graduates. What plans do you have to absorb them into public service?
Raphael Obonyo, Nairobi

The government maintains a data base of all beneficiaries of the programme and keeps track of their progress. The programme is working amazingly well. Already, some interns have been absorbed by the organisations they were deployed to after proving their competency. Others applied and were competitively appointed for positions advertised by the Public Service Commission, while others have left to pursue careers in the private sector. For those who will not have found substantive positions at the expiry of the internship period, they will be considered competitively alongside other deserving applicants for any Public Service jobs advertised by the Public Service Commission.

With only 20 per cent female MPs, Kenya ranks 76th among the top 100 countries, according to the World Classification of Women in National Parliaments, well behind Rwanda and Uganda, where women occupy 56 per cent and 30 per cent, respectively. What practical steps have you taken to ensure women are involved in the socio-economic and political spheres?
Raphael Obonyo, Nairobi

In line with our mandate, the ministry has prioritised women’s economic empowerment through financial inclusion and capacity building of women entrepreneurs and women-led businesses. This is implemented through three affirmative action funds that target women specifically

The Women Enterprise Fund provides accessible and affordable credit and business support services to women entrepreneurs to start or expand business for wealth and employment creation. Second is Uwezo Fund which aims to expand access to finance for the youth, women and persons with disability at the constituency level for businesses and enterprises development. Third is the National Government Affirmative Action Fund (NGAAF) whose objective is to empower vulnerable groups in the society to improve their well-being.

The government has also provided to the marginalised — women, youth and persons with disabilities — opportunity to do business with government through the Access to Government Procurement Opportunities Programme (AGPO). By April 2019, AGPO statistics indicated that tendering had increased to 45,812 tenders being awarded to youth (44 per cent), women (53 per cent) and persons with disabilities (three per cent)-owned enterprises. The impact of these funds has been phenomenal.

You recently tabled before the Senate a report on the distribution of senior positions in the national government across all communities. What have you proposed as a way forward in this matter
Dan Murugu, Nakuru

Chapter Four Article 43 of our Constitution on economic and social rights enshrines fair treatment to all Kenyans. Recruitment in the Public Service is awake to this provision and is undertaken on the basis of fair competition and merit; representation of Kenya’s diverse communities; adequate and equal opportunities to all gender, youth, members of all ethnic groups, persons with disabilities and minorities. Progressively, the provisions of the Constitution will ensure fair inclusivity.

Unlike at the Teachers Service Commission, in public service those who graduated recently are absorbed leaving out earlier graduates. I think this is unfair. What is your take?
James Njoroge Kimani, Subukia

There are guidelines that guide recruitment protocols in every organisation. In the Public Service, the factor of year of completion of candidates is considered alongside other factors stipulated in the Constitution and relevant legislation. Recruitment in the Public Service is undertaken on the basis of fair competition and merit; representation of Kenya’s diverse communities; adequate and equal opportunities to all gender, youth, members of all ethnic groups, persons with disabilities and minorities.

Given the higher retirement age for judges and professors at public universities, why is the same not extended to some cadres in the mainstream civil service?
Githuku Mungai, Nairobi

Different occupations have varied physical, mental and emotional demands on the job holders and thereby necessitate the setting of varying retirement ages. There are management considerations as well. Some job descriptions are extremely specialised and require extensive training and experience that the public service is keen to use to the full benefit of the country. Such personnel may be requested to continue serving for longer than usual. Increasing the mandatory retirement age would also pose succession management challenges in the Public Service.

On several occasions, a bill to entrench the two-thirds gender requirement has been brought to Parliament and defeated. What has been manifestly wrong with the bills?
Francis Njuguna, Kibichoi

The not more than two-thirds provision of the Constitution has contributed to a steady rise of women occupying various decision-making positions. There are more women in Parliament and county assemblies. For example, following the 2017 General Election, women accounted for 33 per cent. From the year 2009, women ministers were only three out of 20 compared to seven women Cabinet secretaries out of 21 in 2020, translating to 33 per cent. There has been remarkable progress within the Judiciary, where women comprise 28.6 per cent in Supreme Court; 36.8 per cent in Court of Appeal; 48.8 per cent in the High Court; and 53.5 per cent of magistrates. Also significant is that women are occupying strategic dockets given that for the first time in Kenya’s history we have the first female Auditor General while the positions of Budget Comptroller, Commission on Revenue Allocation and the Salaries and Revenue Commission are headed by women. Within Parliament, women are also heading important portfolios such as the National Assembly Finance Committee, among others.

Whereas we have not achieved the desired number of women in Parliament, we should continue to work towards the realisation of the not more than two-thirds gender rule considering women comprise 50.5 per cent of the population.

Last year, your ministry and that of the Treasury launched a Rapid Result Initiative on the processing and payments of retired officers. My file was forwarded to the Treasury on October 3, 2019, to date I have not been paid. What could be the issue?

The delay may be due to the manual nature of the process but it is now ready for payment.

Numerous surveys have continued to portray a public service which holds tax-payers in contempt through corruption, delays, absenteeism, arrogance or all sorts of discrimination. What is your take on this and what legacy would you wish to leave in your ministry?
Komen Moris, Eldoret

The public service in Kenya has served the country well, providing all the human resource needed for socio-economic development since independence. Indeed, Kenya public service is a successful global winner in innovative service delivery and provides benchmarks for best practice for governments in this region, including Southern African countries. Despite these successes, the service, being a bureaucratic system, has over the years experienced difficulties in service delivery, especially due to long processes and the manual nature of the same. Recognising this, the government in 2003 embarked on key reforms and introduced Results Based Management in the service. These reforms aimed at transforming the service and making it citizen-centric, responsive, efficient and effective. The reforms have continued over the years and ongoing reforms include performance management system; strengthening of the service through succession management, staff redistribution, rationalisation of staff establishment, entry level recruitment, and promotion of competent and qualified staff. We are currently developing a masterplan on rare and critical skills in the public service and introducing uniform norms and standards to ensure consistency and harmony across the public service. Internally, we are enhancing staff welfare through provision of Civil Servants Medical Scheme, introduction of a Group Life Policy, Contributory Pension to enhance retirement benefits.

To make the public services more accessible to citizens, the government has instituted service digitisation across the functional areas in the public service. Of note, is the establishment of the Huduma Kenya Programme. This is a one-stop shop for highly sought public services. Currently, Huduma has on boarded about 112 services in all the 52 centres across the republic.

We have seen some international lenders like the International Finance Corporation (IFC) providing millions of dollars to financial institutions to lend to SMEs. Unfortunately, Kenya’s banking sector still requires collateral in the form of title deeds to advance credit, yet our youth and women do not have such collateral. What is your ministry doing to ensure that youth and women are not discriminated by these financial institutions when seeking post Covid-19 recovery support?
Elisha N Oduor, Nairobi

Kenya is working on a comprehensive strategy to boost recovery of women and youth-led businesses that have suffered disruptions linked to Covid-19 pandemic. The government has developed an inventory of female and youth-owned enterprises that have suffered due to the pandemic, to facilitate their bailout. The women and youth led businesses will benefit from a stimulus package launched by the government in April to bailout local start-ups affected by the pandemic. This is being done through semi-autonomous government agencies within the ministry, namely; Women Enterprise Fund, Uwezo Fund and National Government Affirmative Action Fund (NGAAF)

The government is also working on a bailout strategy with financial institutions such as IFC to restore the SMEs to profitability. Youth and women-owned enterprises will benefit from LPO financing from commercial banks that have received credit from IFC. The government will also engage the financial institutions to see ways of relaxing the issue of collaterals to youth, women and PLWDs-owned enterprises. "
Walter Menya,"In June 9, 2020, when a court suspended the intended dissolution of the Strategic Food Reserve Trust Fund (SFRTF), its employees sighed with relief.

But that respite lasted just two weeks before chief executive Omar Haji Salat and the staff found themselves without an office and a number of documents were carted away by representatives of the government.

According to an affidavit by Mr Salat, on July 22, 2020, the Secretary of the Presidential Delivery Unit, Mr Andrew Wakahiu, arrived at the fund's offices in the company of an acting Superintendent of the Administration Police one Boniface Ngugi and a contingent of Administration Police officers who broke into the offices on 20th floor in Teleposta Towers.

""The two replaced the office locks, locked the offices and left with the keys paralysing the operations of the fund,"" the CEO says.

The SFRTF is mandated to ensure strategic food reserves in the country by ensuring stability of food supplies and prices and mobilising funds to support related activities.

The falling-out in government has opened the floodgates of accusations, with the CEO feeling besieged, operating without a board and accusing Ministry of Agriculture officials of defrauding the fund.

In an affidavit accompanying Petition No. 145 of 2020 by activist Okiya Omtatah, the CEO accuses Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Peter Munya of ""unlawful and fraudulent"" sale of 124,486 bags (approximately 6,224,300 kilogrammes) of condemned maize worth Sh200 million to a cement factory in Nakuru town.

He says this was ""in contemptuous disregard of the Public Procurement and Asset Disposal Act No. 33 of 2015 and the recommendations by the fund's Oversight Board, through a board resolution, that the maize should be competitively sold for use as energy to interested parties.""

""The sales proceeds worth Sh200 million were not surrendered to the Treasury as extra exchequer receipts"" says Mr Salat. In March, the Cabinet directed that SFRTF be wound up within six months. To wind up the fund, Section 24(8) of the Public Finance Management Act, 2012 provides that the Treasury Cabinet Secretary must get the approval of the National Assembly

But on April 14, National Treasury Cabinet Secretary Ukur Yatani published in the Kenya Gazette a notice of revocation of the Public Finance Management (Strategic Food Reserve Trust Fund) Regulations, 2015.

The fund was set up by these regulations and the revocation of the same meant the fund ceased to exist.

But the revocation of the regulations were challenged in court by Mr Omtatah and the court on June 9 suspended the Public Finance Management (Strategic Food Reserve Trust Fund Revocation) Regulations, 2020, meaning the SFRTF was to continue with its operations.

But Mr Salat's affidavit shows that the government is in a hurry to have the fund disbanded.

There are reports that the government wants to take the functions of SFRTF back to the National Cereals and Produce Board. Besides the allegations against Mr Munya, Mr Salat claims that senior officials in the Agriculture ministry have been misappropriating SFRTF finances.

""I am deeply troubled that this unlawful action (the raid on the fund's offices) may lead to removal/tampering with the fund's documents and records. My fears are reasonable since I am aware that the following events led to disagreement between the fund's Oversight Board and the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, Fisheries and Cooperatives,"" he says. He cites alleged misappropriation of the fund's resources in 2017/2018, which led to the criminal prosecution of senior NCPB and ministry officials, including then principal secretary Richard Lesiyampe.

He also accuses the ministry officials of ""unlawful and fraudulent withdrawal of Sh1.8 billion from the fund's bank account.""

The matter, he states, is under investigation by the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) .

The CEO also alleges that the advance payment of Sh4.8 billion to the NCPB, which is the fund's agent, has yet to be accounted for.

He adds that the 2017/2018 maize sale proceeds of Sh1.5 billion and Sh823 million in 2018/2019 are yet to be paid to the fund. "
Walter Menya,"If things had remained on the straight and narrow, Chinese national Hu Shiwen, 76, would be in his country.

His passport was supposedly stamped at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport on August 30 to show that he was flying out.

That was after questions were raised on his residence status. Mr Shiwen was to travel on a Lufthansa plane from Nairobi to Nanjing through Frankfurt.

Inexplicably, Mr Hu is still in the country as a businessman.

“The man has no permit and is always in and out of the country,” Immigration Services Director-General Alexander Muteshi told the Sunday Nation.

Even without a permit, Mr Hu is a director at Leebeca Enterprises Ltd, whose name he uses for immigration applications.

The company used to supply Nakumatt Supermarket and other firms with clothes from China. Documents show Mr Hu used aliases like Li Xiaofei, Jun Wang, Gu Ruo Cao and Peng Guo Dong to operate bank accounts in Kenya.

Sources at the department said Mr Hu and a 24-year-old Kenyan were arrested and taken to Nyayo House on August 17. They were later freed.

The circumstances of his release and supposed arrangement that he should leave for China on his own volition remain a mystery as are the departure stamp and air tickets.

A top official in the investigation team is said to be at the centre of attempts to bypass the system. Mr Muteshi told the Sunday Nation that no deportation order has been issued.

He added that the Chinese has instead submitted a complaint “regarding people who have defrauded him of his life savings”.

Mr Hu has a case pending in court against another Chinese, Du Fang, with whom he has been fighting over a business deal. Correspondences seen by the Sunday Nation indicates that he has been working behind-the-scenes to get his immigration file from Section F, which is the directorate’s investigations and prosecution department, in order to process a work permit. Files kept in the section are flagged.

“I am seriously pushing to get your file from Section F so that I can work over it but my hands are tied. Without the file, I cannot do anything. Be patient with us,” Mr Hu is told in a communication with an officer who pledges to work “round the clock to ensure you get your permit”.

From the communication, it also emerges that the same individual helped the Chinese get a visa extension. "
Walter Menya,"Murang'a Senator Irungu Kang'ata knows a thing or two about the law, governance and politics, but does he understand democracy as practised in the Commonwealth? The Senate minority which responds to your questions.

Some of your colleagues have openly claimed that our bicameral Parliament is ‘dead’. In fact, they claim its committees are just but glorified ‘sanitisation booths’ meant to cleanse those who appear before them, including the Kirinyaga Governor. As the Senate Majority Whip, what is your take on this? Can Parliament redeem its image?

Komen Moris, Eldoret

I respect the opinion that Parliament is ‘dead’ but beg to differ. Both Houses have made recommendations that have led to convictions in courts, hence debunking the ‘sanitising booth’ narrative. The maize scandal that led to recent jailing of two prominent persons was unearthed by the National Assembly in 2015, and several governors are currently facing prosecution on the strength of recommendations of the Senate’s PAC. One impeachment should not be used to gauge overall performance of an institution, otherwise one would be guilty of the fallacy of false generalisation. The verdict for the Kirinyaga Governor’s case was rendered on its merits based on the evidence presented.

Whipping demands of elected politicians to first obey their party, not to serve their constituents. As such, it is a potent symbol of what many perceive to be wrong with our politics. The electorate is tired of party-line-toeing loyalists, preferring independently minded politicians with strong values. What are you doing to ensure political parties do not suppress the voice of the individual representatives, but unite those with a common cause?

Raphael Obonyo, Nairobi

Senators in Jubilee have been able to override the divisions as exemplified by how they have voted in the revenue sharing debate.

As a youthful leader who has risen very fast in politics, having served as a student leader at the University of Nairobi, a councillor, an MP and Senator at 37, what advice would you give to budding young politicians?

Maina Wanja, Kiambu County

Kenya has enshrined freedoms of expression and of thought, which must be enjoyed by all Kenyans, including elected politicians. However, Article 38 of the Constitution, as read with the Political Parties Act, anchors political parties in Kenya’s democratic foundations. Having read manifestos and elected to join political parties as opposed to vying as independent candidates, elected politicians are enjoined to adhere to their party tenets. Parties, including Jubilee, have constitutions which often give instances when elected politicians can act ‘independently’. This strengthens politics, in my view, because this ‘toeing party line’ produces predictable and stable politics based on a publicly available party manifesto. Jubilee’s constitution provides that “a member of the National Assembly or Senate shall not, without justification, oppose party positions and policy in Parliament”.

Senators don’t have kitties and developmental funds to carry out social and related activities like members of the National Assembly, who have CDF, and Governors, who have access to conditional grants and shareable revenues. With such a disadvantage, how can Senators meaningfully participate in the development of their counties?

Sammy Kahura

The constitutional doctrine of separation of power posits that parliamentarians should make laws and oversight whereas governors and presidents execute development. If one fuses developmental and oversight functions, checks and balances will collapse and open the doors for abuse of power. There will be no one to oversight MPs’ developmental funds and hence I support the current status quo. However, due to voters’ expectations, I often lobby various development projects through relevant ministries for my Murang’a County residents. In July 2020 I organised a meeting in Nairobi where the Murang’a Development Plan was discussed. It is now being implemented.

During the burial of Charles Rubia you told the President not to appoint the 41 Judges recommended to him by the JSC. Don’t you feel your utterances were a contempt of the High Court verdict that had found the continued delay to appoint the judges a gross violation of the law?

Andrew Maranga Ratemo, Nairobi

The law of contempt does not bar the public from criticising judgments rendered by courts as long as the criticism is objective and impersonal. I guess my criticism was fair and objective. If construed otherwise, Kenya would be setting a dangerous precedent of hoisting one arm of the government (read Judiciary) above the Constitution. In some democracies like Japan and the US, to ensure judicial decisions rhyme with public views, most judges are elected directly by the people and hence criticism of judicial decisions is the norm.

The ‘Handshake’ seems to be derailing and interfering with Parliamentary democracy. Besides governance, how has it been helpful in legislation, representation and oversight in respect to the Senate?

Dan Murugu, Nakuru

For the first time in its history, the Senate was able to successfully prosecute an impeachment of a governor under the Handshake arrangement. This was oversight at its best. Notwithstanding the current stalemate, discussions on revenue sharing in senate have been enabled by the Handshake.

Jubilee Party is currently so divided that leaders have been speaking at each other and no side is interested in listening to the other. How do you whip Senators when the chasms among them run so deep? What would have to happen for Jubilee to come back together?

Alfonse Oliech, Elburgon

I guess people excel in the field they have a keen interest in. All factors being constant — ceteris paribus — the more hours one puts on a subject the more likely one will succeed. Hence success tends to be proportional to the input hours. If you want to excel in sports, exercise more. If you want to succeed in academia, read more. The point is, I grew up reading and following politics, both nationally and internationally. I guess ‘trying’ can assist — try to vie for a position. If you fail, learn the lessons and make amends for the future.

You and the current Jubilee leadership appear hell-bent on crushing any form of opposition like Saul of Tarsus. Kenyans paid dearly to end Kanu’s one-party dictatorship. Why are you determined to take us back there as Senate Majority Whip?

Carey Yiembe, Mombasa

Jubilee is not hell-bent on crushing any form of opposition. We are democrats who respect diverse opinions.

Why is the CRA not given the final say on the formula for revenue sharing among counties? Leaving it to politicians is not the best option, in my view, because they mess up everything.

Githuku Mungai, Nairobi

The Constitution notes that CRA’s role in this debate is advisory. Nothing more! Whereas CRA is staffed with very competent experts on matters development and public finance, I think it is best to have politicians have the final say on this issue. This is because politicians, unlike CRA which is an unelected body, have the electoral legitimacy to discuss and render decisions on complex policy issues like revenue sharing. Despite the shortcomings, elected politicians understand ‘political nuances’ better than unelected agencies of government. For example, in this revenue sharing debate, CRA has tended to bring proposals that exacerbate the problem like a formula where more counties lose revenue. Proposals by politicians, on the other hand, have geared towards reducing the number of losing counties or minimizing the losses. This is positive to me.

Two months ago you sat in the disciplinary proceedings against Jubilee Party Nominated Senators who were accused of disrespecting President Uhuru Kenyatta after snubbing his invitation to State House. What is the progress on that matter?

Dan Murugu, Nakuru

The senators were heard by the party’s disciplinary committee. However, according to the Jubilee constitution, that committee’s decision is not final. It has to be ratified by the National Executive Committee (NEC) that comprises, among others, chairman of the party, myself as the whip and President Uhuru Kenyatta as the party leader. NEC is yet to meet. Once it meets, a decision will be communicated. Of course I am on record having proposed the said members be treated leniently.

As MP of Kiharu between 2013 and 2017, you are credited with lobbying for tarmacking various roads. Now that you hold a senior position in government, what can we, your constituents, expect in so far as seeing more roads being tarmacked?

Noah Gachanja, Murang’a

The good job being done in Murang’a is also being done nationally. I have visited coastal, western and northern parts of this country and seen good work being done by the government. But, to respond to your query, in conjunction with Murang’a MPs, we have lobbied to have Mau Mau Road that traverses Gatanga, Kigumo, Kiharu, Kangema and Mathioya constituencies to be tarmacked. Mbombo-Igikiro-Makuyu-Lower Gatanga Road is almost complete. And many others.

Icagaki and Kahumbu roads in Kigumo and Maragwa are being done. The main Kandara road which leads into Githumu and Kangari has been redone. Mgala muue lakini haki mpe. President Uhuru Kenyatta has done an excellent job in terms of infrastructure in the entire country. My work as a whip is to assist his government.

In the 2017 elections, you campaigned jointly with Governor Mwangi wa Iria yet it now seems the two of you have fallen and it was clear for all to see when the governor was before the Senate Committee over usage of public funds. What led to the fallout?

Abdalla Mwalango, Kimorori Wempa, Maragua

What I raise in the Senate in regard to Muranga is not personal but it is strictly restricted to issues raised by the Auditor General. Therefore, I do not view it as a fall-out per se but rather it is execution of expected duties of the senate. The steps of an audit process include entry meeting, exit meeting, draft report, management letter and finally the report which the auditor tables before the senate. All these are ample opportunities given to the governor to respond and or rebut various issues and hence avoid grilling by Senate.

Majority of counties particularly from Rift valley are likely to benefit from the proposed revenue sharing formula yet they are rejecting it. What, in your view, could be the reason for their rejection of the proposed revenue sharing basis?

Dickie Murimi, Kirinyaga

Thanks but I am not sure if indeed it is factually correct to state majority of counties from Rift Valley have rejected the revenue sharing formula. For example, West Pokot, Uasin Gishu, Nandi, Bomet, Trans Nzoia, Kajiado, Nakuru and Laikipia (and Kericho in some instances ), have all supported the formula. It is only Elgeyo Marakwet delegation which has consistently supported an alternative view which it thinks is better.

You have never lost an election from the time you took a plunge in electoral politics. Reports out there suggest that you could be considering going for the Murang’a governor position in 2022. On the other hand, with the new seat that you now hold, your enhanced national profile and enhanced educational background, you could choose to aim for a national position like deputy prime minister post-2022 if BBI creates it. What are your 2022 plans?

Peter Njuguna

Thanks for your compliment, I am humbled. However, let me concentrate on my current immense duties. Let us cross the 2022 bridge when we get there. That is what the president has told every Jubilee legislator to do.

"
Walter Menya,"This week Mr Silas Kinoti, the director-general of the Kenya Urban Roads Authority, responds to your questions.  

 What is Kura’s grand plan to improve Kenya’s urban roads?

Congratulations for upgrading Outer Ring Road, which has reduced the journey time between Thika Road and Airport North from hours to just a few minutes. However, you need to find a solution on loading zones to remove public service vehicles from the carriageway. What plans do you have on other major urban arterial roads within Nairobi, like Kasarani-Mwiki Road, Kamiti Road, Juja Road, Komarock Road and Naivasha Road?

Eng Gitonga Z, Nairobi Metropolitan Services

We upgraded Outer Ring Road to reduce travel time between Thika Highway and Mombasa Road from two hours to 11 minutes. This has been achieved. Traffic flow, however, experiences minimal delays as PSVs keep picking passengers on the corridor yet we have adequate bus bays along the whole section of the road. Kura is working on the installation of the last footbridge which should be done in the next few weeks. I call upon the public to use designated pedestrian crossings and PSVs to pick passengers at bus stops. Plans are at advanced stage to increase the capacities of all other arterial corridors you have mentioned. Dualling of Kasarani–Mwiki Road, James Gichuru Road, Limuru Road and Kiambu Road is underway, while Juja Road is planned as a BRT corridor and will be expanded. We also plan to dual Ngong Road from Karen to Ngong town and expand Naivasha Road.

There is often some confusion among the public as to who ‘owns’ which road between Kura and Kenha. How can the public tell which road belongs to which agency?

Francis Njuguna, Kibichoi.

All the three authorities were formed through The Kenya Roads Act, 2007. Kura was formed to manage national urban road networks and has presence in all county headquarters as well as other major towns in the country. KeNHA was mandated to manage national trunk roads, while Kenya Rural Roads Authority (KeRRA) is mandated to manage rural road network as well as roads that connect one county to another, and other classified roads in small towns.

The Ngara Road stretch from Fig Tree junction to Gymkhana has been worn-out for over three years. How long will we wait before the road is recarpeted?

Mellow Investments, Nairobi.

 Ngara Road is among many other roads due for rehabilitation in the next few months under our programme with Nairobi Metropolitan Services (NMS). We have already procured contractors to rehabilitate it and other roads in Westlands, Parklands and the CBD.

What is your authority doing to stem the vandalism of safety gear and signs across the country?

Komen Moris, Eldoret.



We have engaged the public, police and other stakeholders in trying to solve this problem. We are in consultation with the Inspector-General of Police for formation of a dedicated unit to deal with vandalism on our roads. We have piloted this in Nairobi and achieved very good results. We are also engaging institutions of higher learning to come up with alternative and non-reusable materials for use as road furniture. My appeal to the public is to support this initiative by reporting those vandalising public facilities intended to serve all of us. We also appeal to those businesses benefitting from this vice to stop. The law will catch up with them and it will be very punitive.

 You oversaw construction of Ngong Road, one of the finest roads in Kenya. Are there plans to build similar roads in Nairobi and other urban centres in the country in the near future?

Zachary Ochieng’, Kisumu County.

Thanks for the compliment. We are planning to expand major roads in Nairobi and other towns. In Kisumu, for example, we are upgrading and modernising more than 10 kilometres of roads and contractors are already on the ground. Kura commits to always maintain standards in expanding our streets to make them friendly for use by all — motorised and non- motorised — traffic.

What should Kenyans expect in terms of improvement of the urban road infrastructure, especially in Nairobi?

Marcus Muli.

 We will continue to implement ongoing road works as well as new road projects. We intend to reach out to other upcoming small towns as well as improving access to major public institutions and other national strategic installations. Kura is determined to increase Non-Motorist Transport (NMTS) facilities to improve public safety.

As I lead KURA to the next level, I am very much aware that the world is becoming a global village through information technology. We will leverage on technology to reduce traffic congestion in our towns and wholesomely manage our road network. We have piloted the use Intelligent Transport System (ITS) to reduce congestion in our roads. Nairobi residents can bare me witness that the traffic snarl-ups we used to have along the Ring Road Kilimani corridor (Prestige Mall Junction—Yaya Centre—Ring Road Kileleshwa—Arboretum—Weslands Roundabout) are a thing of the past. We have used modern technology to achieve this.

During public participation hearings for the planned elevation of Nakuru Town to city status local residents, members of the business community and other stakeholders vouched for the implementation of an Integrated Urban Transport Master Plan in the road sector to cater for, among others, pedestrian walkways and security cameras. What will Kura do actualise this?

Dan Murugu, Nakuru

Kura has been one of the key partners in the struggle by Nakuru to attain a city status by constructing over 25 kilometres of new tarmac in the last three years. We also note that the town is increasingly becoming congested and we will continue to upgrade town roads as well as plan to introduce new arterial roads. The success of Kura ITS system in Nairobi will be replicated in other towns, including Nakuru in the near future. We also recently completed feasibility studies and preliminary engineering designs for the Nakuru Northern bypass, which will divert traffic at Mbaruk through Maili Kumi and join the Nakuru-Kisumu road at Sobea.

 Majority of trips in Kenya are made by walking and cycling, with only a small per cent made by private cars, which are predominantly found in Nairobi, yet priorities on the streets do not serve the needs of the majority. Kenya developed a non-motorised policy in 2015. What are you doing to implement the policy in order to improve the walking and cycling environment and catalyse investment in non-motorised transport?

Raphael Obonyo, Nairobi.

We have constructed over 600 kilometres of footpaths and cycle paths in the country and also invested in the building of footbridges to increase public safety. Our design for urban road network considers the provision of the facilities as research has shown that over 50 per cent of urban dwellers walk to and from work. We are implementing modern street designs geared towards making our streets liveable and attractive for everyone.

 Unlike most urban centres, Busia town, which is the headquarters of Busia County, has literally no road classified under Kura. Are we in your plans on matters road development?

James Ouma, Busia County.

Yes, there currently are no roads classified as national urban roads in Busia and we are undertaking feasibility studies and preliminary designs of several roads there and in Vihiga for purposes of understanding the network which may lead to prioritised resource allocation.

 You have over 20 years’ experience in the management of road infrastructure in the country. What, in your view, are some of the key challenges facing the road construction sector?

Paul Mbugua, Kiambu County.

We have the usual challenges of inadequate resources, road corridor encroachment, vandalism, expensive land acquisition for design accommodation, and abuse of road use protocols. Why do we have this inherent perception that being a roads contractor is the ticket to quick economic empowerment? We have local contractors who cannot compete with their international counterparts. Infrastructure development is a key enabler to economic development of any middle income economy like ours. There is therefore a need for the government to deploy more resources to support infrastructural improvement. In my opinion, this sector should be regulated, just like the energy sector, to get value for every shilling.

Sir, can you demonstrate compliance to legal and statutory requirement in environment, Occupational Health and Safety in the KURA development activities?

Dominic Kangogo, Moiben, Uasin Gishu County

Kura is ISO 9001:2015 certified. We conduct governance and Legal Compliance Audit as required by relevant laws. I can comfortably say KURA is a highly compliant institution. We adhere to all requirements on safety and environment.  We undertake Environmental and Social Impact Assessment in all our projects and safety is given top priority in all our activities. We have a fully-fledged Department of Environment and Safety Safeguards. "
Walter Menya,"Had the Committee of Experts (CoE) had its way during the review of the constitution, the country would be having a hybrid system of government exactly as recommended by the initial Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) task force report.

It means Kenya would be having an elected president, a prime minister and two deputy prime ministers elected by parliament.

In addition, the Cabinet would be made up of professionals and MPs, as the BBI proposes.

Further, the Harmonised Draft Constitution which was the product of the CoE, sought to entrench in the constitution the office of the leader of the official opposition in parliament, complete with a shadow cabinet and a secretariat.

However, the proposals and others, would be cast aside once the political class, through the Parliamentary Select Committee (PSC) on Constitutional Review, took charge.

PSC members met at Great Rift Valley Lodge, Naivasha as they thrashed out the document that would become the 2010 Constitution of Kenya amid pressure from major political formations – the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) and the Party of National Unity (PNU) – religious groups, the international community and Kenyans in general. The process and product of the Naivasha talks PSC continues to divide opinion.

Mr Nzamba Kitonga, who chaired CoE, says the recommendations in the initial report of the BBI task force vindicates his team’s proposals and that PSC was not justified in discarding them.

“Indeed, it is the mistakes of the Naivasha PSC which have come to haunt Kenya. The harmonised draft contained all the provisions of the expanded Executive contained in BBI. These provisions were intended to create national cohesion and harmony,” Mr Kitonga says.

He adds that Naivasha mutilated the Senate and designated it as the lower House against experience all over the world.

The original proposal was to let bills flow from the National Assembly to the Senate for approval then to the President for assent. As it is, the Senate was retained with a narrow mandate of just overseeing devolution.

It is a view shared by Prof Musili Wambua of the University Of Nairobi School of Law. According to Prof Wambua, who was a member of the Constitution of Kenya Review Commission (CKRC), the problems being experienced with the Constitution are due to the fact that politicians had a lot of leeway in the process, mainly in Naivasha.

He says the CoE’s Harmonised Draft was largely a reflection of the Bomas Draft, “which reflected the views of a majority of Kenyans”.

“We gave too much leeway to politicians. They did not look at the long term,” he said.

But the man who chaired PSC – Abdikadir Mohamed – does not believe his team mutilated the CoE proposals.

He says CoE was a creation of Parliament and that its constitutive Act did not give it the final say on the document produced.

“The perception that these were the good guys who wanted to get the best constitution for the country and the PSC was out to kill their proposal is not correct,” Mr Mohamed told the Nation.

He added that CoE had no business dwelling much on contentious issues like the system of government to be adopted.

“The idea was to deliver a politically settled document before taking the country to the referendum,” Mr Mohamed said. “Without Naivasha, we would not be having this Constitution. We did not fight in 2007 and 2008 or lose the 2005 referendum because we did not have a good document. On both occasions, we did not have a political settlement. Therefore, Naivasha was important.”

As debate on whether or not to amend the Constitution 10 years after it was promulgated, Prof Wambua says this could have been avoided if the hybrid system of government proposed by Bomas and the CoE had been allowed.

“It was a big mistake to go the presidential route. What we should have been doing was to deconcentrate power from the presidency,” Prof Wambua said.

“If that was done properly, we would not be going back to the Bomas Draft which is what we are doing.”

As the 2010 Constitution reaches its 10th year, the value of the Naivasha retreat to the process of delivering the document is still being debated. For those who believe Naivasha was critical, the key argument is that it offered an avenue for political settlement which would otherwise would not have been possible through CoE.

“The idea then was to sit, discuss, compromise and agree on the way forward,” Mr Mohamed said.

Recalling the Naivasha days, Mr Mohamed says Eldoret North MP William Ruto and his Gichugu counterpart Martha Karua were the most active PSC members.

“They would be up late when the others were asleep,” he recalls. "

It is a view shared by Prof Musili Wambua of the University Of Nairobi School of Law. According to Prof Wambua, who was a member of the Constitution of Kenya Review Commission (CKRC), the problems being experienced with the Constitution are due to the fact that politicians had a lot of leeway in the process, mainly in Naivasha.

He says the CoE’s Harmonised Draft was largely a reflection of the Bomas Draft, “which reflected the views of a majority of Kenyans”.

“We gave too much leeway to politicians. They did not look at the long term,” he said.

But the man who chaired PSC – Abdikadir Mohamed – does not believe his team mutilated the CoE proposals.

He says CoE was a creation of Parliament and that its constitutive Act did not give it the final say on the document produced.

“The perception that these were the good guys who wanted to get the best constitution for the country and the PSC was out to kill their proposal is not correct,” Mr Mohamed told the Nation.

He added that CoE had no business dwelling much on contentious issues like the system of government to be adopted.

“The idea was to deliver a politically settled document before taking the country to the referendum,” Mr Mohamed said. “Without Naivasha, we would not be having this Constitution. We did not fight in 2007 and 2008 or lose the 2005 referendum because we did not have a good document. On both occasions, we did not have a political settlement. Therefore, Naivasha was important.”

As debate on whether or not to amend the Constitution 10 years after it was promulgated, Prof Wambua says this could have been avoided if the hybrid system of government proposed by Bomas and the CoE had been allowed.

“It was a big mistake to go the presidential route. What we should have been doing was to deconcentrate power from the presidency,” Prof Wambua said.

“If that was done properly, we would not be going back to the Bomas Draft which is what we are doing.”

As the 2010 Constitution reaches its 10th year, the value of the Naivasha retreat to the process of delivering the document is still being debated. For those who believe Naivasha was critical, the key argument is that it offered an avenue for political settlement which would otherwise would not have been possible through CoE.

“The idea then was to sit, discuss, compromise and agree on the way forward,” Mr Mohamed said.

Recalling the Naivasha days, Mr Mohamed says Eldoret North MP William Ruto and his Gichugu counterpart Martha Karua were the most active PSC members.

“They would be up late when the others were asleep,” he recalls. "
Walter Menya,"The Kenya Bureau of Standards is tasked with the responsibility of ensuring that the goods and services Kenyans consume meet basic quality and safety requirements. Has it done its job well? Are Kenyans satisfied with its performance so far? Mr Bernard Njiraini, the Managing Director, responds to your questions.

Corruption at ports: In sampling, testing, labelling and stamping of approved goods and products, Kebs officers have been accused of wanton corruption that compromises the health of end users. This is rampant at the port of Mombasa and border posts. How do you intend to fight this menace? Dan Murugu, Nakuru

As a national standards body, our top most priority is the protection of safety and health of consumers. We have established elaborate systems that ensure sampling and testing of locally manufactured and imported goods are conducted in a structured manner. Dissatisfied customers have alternative arbitration mechanisms -- through a tribunal as well as requests for re-tests.

We have three layers of inspection: Pre-export Verification of Conformity (PVOC) at the country of origin, risk-based random sampling at the ports of entry, and market surveillance when goods are placed for sale in supermarkets and shops. Our strategy to fight against substandard products is through our campaign, ""Wajibika na Kebs"" , which aims at creating awareness for quality checks on our products through verification on the validity of the standardisation mark on the products before purchase by sending the code underneath the mark to 20023 (SM#Code) to get product validity status details.

Bags standards: Pursuant to Gazette Notice 2356 of February 28, 2017, Kebs approved the use of 100 per cent biodegradable bags (starch and cassava bags) as alternatives to banned plastic bags. On the basis of this notice I developed a business plan with an international company already producing biodegradable bags from cassava starch in Asia. For the joint venture to materialise, the international partner requested for approval of standards before we could proceed. I sent several emails to Kebs but didn't get any response. I visited your offices in South C and met a woman who informed me that such bags cannot be imported or manufactured in Kenya due to lack of standards and regulations for managing their manufacture or importation. Why did Kebs include such bags as alternatives to plastics without setting the regulations? And when will these standards be developed and gazetted? Elisha N Oduor, Nairobi.

First, let me correct you. The Gazette Notice No 2356 of February 28, 2017 was not issued by Kebs, but by then Cabinet Secretary for Environment and Natural Resources. There has been no time that Kebs has approved the use of 100 per cent biodegradable plastic bags. The standards are being discussed at the technical committee level and we shall have them ready by June 2021.

In the meantime, we have adopted ISO 17088 Specifications for compostable plastics. However, these are only suitable in situations where they will end up in an industrial compost. For the time being, this is not possible in the country. Regarding the many unanswered mails that you sent to Kebs, I take note and will follow up to ensure that such never happens again.

Aflatoxin in food: There have been several instances of some millers selling maize flour with aflatoxin, yet your organisation exists to ensure consumers get good and healthy products. Is this all because of corruption? Michael Ngunjiri, Mukurweini.

Aflatoxin in food arises from growth of fungi that release the toxin called aflatoxin. It comes as a result of poor handling of cereals and can be introduced at any stage of the value chain, including at home, as long as the conditions are favourable for growth of the fungus.

Manufacturers are responsible, through their backward and forward supply systems, for controls to prevent conditions that encourage growth of the fungus. Kebs has been at the forefront in fighting the aflatoxin menace through sensitisation of food safety and market surveillance campaigns, but is also the responsibility of the food business operator to ensure that the food being offered for sale to the public is safe for consumption.

Original vs Counterfeit: Cases of substandard goods in the market have been so common that some traders ask you if you want original products or counterfeits because there are price differences. How much does this affect our economy and what is your organisation doing about it? Francis Njuguna, Kibichoi.

Market demand diversity dictates that there should be variety in terms of the degree of quality based on people's purchase power, hence there will always be products with different prices and quality. However, our standards always define the minimum specifications for proper functioning of the products. We are consistently developing standards that are consistent with market needs and have also enhanced our market surveillance.

Why were you arrested? In early July you were arrested and spent some considerable amount of time at the EACC offices in Nairobi, and the allegation was that you were obstructing investigations into allegations of bribery in the procurement of tenders for pre-export conformity of goods, used motor vehicles and spare parts at Kebs. The fact that you had to be arrested could suggest you were trying to hide something. Could you speak on this and explain why Kebs was not cooperating in the investigations. Leonard Kanji, Nairobi.

Kebs is a government agency and operates under public service guidelines. All documents at Kebs are public, held and preserved as per the procedures of government documents control. In compliance to our controls on documents, which requires, among other things, identifications, duplications, serialisation, and authorisation from the various user departments, delays were misconstrued to be hiding documents.

Quality of masks: Several weeks ago KEBS banned three types of substandard masks arguing that they are risky and give one a false sense of protection against Covid-19. What should one look at when purchasing a face mask? Dickie Murimi, Kirinyaga.

Kebs operates a product certification scheme that entails allowing manufacturer who meet standards to apply the standardisation mark on the product. The mark is issued after an evaluation of a company's production systems to ensure the manufacturer has quality controls in place and after demonstrating compliance with the standard. The validity of the mark can be verified by sending the permit number indicated under the mark in an SMS message in the format SM#PermitNo to 20023. A response giving details of the right owner of the permit will be received and this should match the details on the actual product on which the mark is displayed. For the general public, this should be the tool to use to verify that the product has been subjected to the certification programme and found to be in compliance to set requirements and thus safe to use. Hips and breasts enhancers: What is the role of Kebs in regulating the importation and sale in Kenya of hips and breast enhancement products? They are all over the place yet they do not bear any standards mark or anything to show that they have been approved for sale in Kenya. Brenda K Wabomba, Busia.

Health-related products are regulated under various laws and there are various agencies involved. Kebs' role is to check if a product meets the requirements of the applicable standards. As for suitability to a specific consumer, it is important that an evaluation by a qualified professional is undertaken because of potential side effects that may vary between individuals. Any product intended to alter either the appearance or functioning the body should only be used under the professional advice of a qualified medical practitioner.

Inspecting cars: In the contentious tender to expand the field for pre-export conformity of goods, used motor vehicles and spare parts, what was the wisdom in Kebs bringing in more players just a year before the existing contract was due to expire? Don't you think you exposed Kebs to potential litigation for varying an existing contract mid-way? Phanuel Mogusu, Nairobi.

The main objective of expanding the PVOC contract was to improve service delivery to importers of used motor vehicles and spare parts. And as you know, data never lies; there has been great improvement of that programme much to the delight of importers and the general Kenyan public. "
Walter Menya,"The Ministry of Lands and the National Land Commission (NLC) have agreed to roll out electronic transactions in Nairobi even as a number of contentious issues between them remain unresolved.

The Land Registration (Electronic Transactions) Regulations (2020), the Land (Amendment) Regulations (2020), the Survey (Electronic Cadastre Transactions) Regulations(2020), and the Survey (Amendment) Regulations (2020) were published on July 9 and took effect on July 14, marking the start of online land transactions within the capital city –for now.

The regulations that have been gazetted so far relate to registration, providing for an electronic register and online transactions in the registration process and surveys and cadastral maps (providing for an electronic cadastre).

This means that all ordinary citizens or their advocates will be able to effect practically all transactions, including searches and lodging of transfers and charges, online.

But pending regulations which are still subject of negotiations relate to physical planning, processes of allocation of public land and renewal of leases.

Ministry and NLC sources say the pending regulations do not hinder the roll out of the digital platform and the ongoing talks are meant to determine whether there is need to review those regulations over time. The rollout of the online transactions was preceded by tensions between the ministry and NLC, with the latter saying that it had been side-lined in the development of the regulations and that the task force that developed them went beyond their terms of reference to propose wholesome amendments to existing regulations without consulting key partners in the management of land.

Furthermore, there was push to have some land laws amended before the implementation of the regulations on electronic transactions. For example, the regulations made proposals that affected registration, allotment and renewal of leases among others and which the commission had asked to be regularised first.

The ministry and NLC held a series of meetings in which the two sets of regulations; which are the primary ones in ensuring digitisation, were broadly agreed upon. The regulations published are still subject to forms approval by Parliament.

As the contentious issues persisted, the ministry, on the other hand, was targeting early to mid-July for the roll out of the online transactions.

Following talks that started in May, the commission told the Nation that they agreed to isolate the sticky issues and consult further. NLC chair Gershom Otachi says that the engagement with the ministry “addressed issues of concern and facilitated the take-off of electronic transactions.”

The ministry also agreed to amendments to the existing laws, particularly on registration of land which is at the heart of the electronic transactions.

“Now there is hope that digitisation of land transactions is on track and will not be held back by legal hitches even as we consult further on unresolved issues. I am confident that any pending issues, which have little bearing on the roll out of the electronic system, will be resolved in the context of the ongoing engagements,” said Mr Otachi.

With the electronic transactions regulations now in force, anyone wishing to buy, transfer or lease land in Nairobi will be required to register in the online land registry, the National Land Information System (NLIS) and provide their personal identification numbers (PINs) for taxation purposes. "
Walter Menya,"There was no time to waste. As soon as Tanzania’s Court of Appeal of delivered its ruling on July 3 to free three Kenyans who had been in jail for 15 years for robbery, lawyers quickly arranged for their exit.

William Onyango Nganyi, Patrick Muthee Mrithi, and Simon Ndungu Kiambuthi crossed into Kenya not long after the court released them and went into quarantine.

When the Sunday Nation reached out to Mr Nganyi, his family said he wanted to rest after spending 15 years in prison.

The trio was convicted for violently robbing the National Bank of Commerce (NBC) Moshi branch of Tsh5.3 billion (Sh244 million at the current exchange rate) on May 21, 2004.

Theirs is a tale of betrayal by the authorities and among themselves and their Mozambican contact, torture and killings.

The Tanzanian authorities were accused of unlawfully arresting 10 Kenyans and a Tanzanian in Maputo, a claim Dar es Salaam denied, saying the 11 were arrested at the Julius Nyerere International Airport after being brought by a Mozambican military aircraft. Their lawyers maintain that they were “kidnapped from Mozambique by Tanzanian authorities in 2005 and illegally extradited to Tanzania.”

One of their lawyers, Cliff Ombeta, had to escape from a Tanzanian police station on the border of Tanzania and Mozambique after he was picked up from the Maputo International Airport en route to Nairobi.

He had secured the release of the 10 Kenyans, who had been accused of robbery in Mozambique, and they were waiting to board a Kenya Airways flight to Nairobi.

Before that, he had also successfully defended the 10 in Kenyan courts against extradition to Tanzania.

Mr Ombeta told the Sunday Nation that Kenyan police officers who had travelled to Mozambique to follow up the case of the 11 took away their passports. He says they were told to travel on a different airline.

“Kenyan police are the ones who handed our guys to Tanzania,” said Mr Ombeta.

Mr Ombeta says he was bundled into a van and driven to the border with Tanzania, where he was held at a station.

An opportunity arose when the police assigned to guard him got distracted. “I changed clothes and wore a cap. I unlocked the door and walked out, leaving my bag, crossed to the Mozambican side and took a taxi back to Maputo,” he said.

In Maputo, he took another taxi to the South African border and crossed on foot. He then took a bus to Johannesburg from where he flew back to Nairobi.

“We had defeated the Tanzanians twice in court and they wanted to arrest me because I was defending the Kenyans,” he said.

A warrant for Mr Ombeta’s arrest issued by Tanzanian authorities still stands and the lawyer says he has no intention of going anywhere near the neighbouring country . His clients said they were tortured.

“They were subjected to beatings and torture before being charged with murder and armed robbery, among other charges,” said their lawyers Donald Deya and Evelyn Chijarira from the Pan African Lawyers Union.

As the trial dragged on, one of the suspects, John Odongo Odhiambo died in custody. Authorities said that he died of HIV-related complications but lawyers and relatives said he had been tortured.

With no end in sight, the suspects filed a case against the Government of Tanzania at the African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights (African Court) on July 18, 2013 on the grounds that their cases at the national level had been unduly prolonged, they had been illegally extradited from Mozambique and had been tortured by Tanzanian authorities,.

When the trial court eventually rendered its decision, five of them, Michael Mbanya Wathigo, David Ngugi Mburu, Boniface Mwangi Mburu, Peter Gikura Mburu and Simon Githinji Kariuki, were acquitted. The other six, including Nganyi, Mrithi and Kiambuthi, were each sentenced to 32 years in prison. The others who were convicted were Gabriel Kungu Kariuki, Jimmy Maina Njoroge and Jumanne Kilongola, a Tanzanian national.

Appealed their conviction

Boniface Mwangi Mburu and Simon Githinji Kariuki later travelled back to Tanzania and were killed by Tanzanian authorities under circumstances their lawyers said have never been explained to them.

The five appealed their conviction.  Mr Nganyi, Mr Mrithi and Mr Kiambuthi were set free on the grounds that the prosecution and the police had mishandled the identification parades. In one of the cases, the witness was not called to testify during trial.

“We hold that the appeals by first (Mr Nganyi), second (Mr Mrithi) and fifth (Mr Kiambuthi) appellants are merited and we allow them. Thus, we quash and set aside their respective convictions and sentences, and order their immediate release from prison unless lawfully held for some other cause,” the court ruled.

With the release of the three, two more Kenyans remain in prison.

The option of a regional court is, however, a long shot as the lawyers say that none of the previous orders issued by the African Court have ever been implemented.

The Sunday Nation understands that the release of the three may not be the end of their woes, as one of them, who was once jailed in Kamiti Maximum Security Prison, has been on the Kenyan police radar. "
Walter Menya,"Wiper Democratic Movement leader Kalonzo Musyoka has said he has a secret pact with Orange Democratic Movement leader Raila Odinga on how they will work together in 2022.

In an exclusive interview with the Sunday Nation, Mr Musyoka said the pact is separate from the 2017 National Super Alliance (Nasa) coalition agreement that included Amani National Congress leader Musalia Mudavadi, Ford-Kenya’s Moses Wetang’ula and Chama Cha Mashinani’s Isaac Ruto.

According to Mr Musyoka, even though Nasa is dead, he has signed an agreement with Mr Odinga on how they will approach the 2022 elections. He refused to disclose details of the deal to this writer, but said it was entered into without the knowledge of the other Nasa principals.

“You cannot just assume that since I was the deputy to Raila, then ODM has to support me,” he said. “These things have to be done expressly, which is what we have done under a separate arrangement that I can’t disclose at this stage. The arrangement is between Raila and I and not with the other parties in Nasa. I am not free to talk about it because it is a highly confidential matter,” said Mr Musyoka. Talk of a secret agreement with Mr Odinga comes at a time Mr Musyoka is also pursuing a post-election coalition arrangement with Jubilee Party. He, however, dismissed talk of him working together with Deputy President William Ruto, saying he was focused on the coalition with Jubilee under the leadership of President Uhuru Kenyatta.

Mr Musyoka also narrated how ODM has frustrated the Nasa coalition arrangement to the point of total dysfunction, forcing Wiper to initiate the process of disengaging from the alliance that was formed ahead of the 2017 General Elections.

Mr Musyoka’s claims of a 2022 secret pact with Mr Odinga while blaming his party ODM for the near collapse of Nasa, and his confessed pursuit of a coalition arrangement with Jubilee, sound contradictory and confusing at the same time.

The former vice-president’s revelations come just days after his party’s National Executive Committee (NEC) recommend that Wiper initiates the process to withdraw from Nasa because the coalition is “dysfunctional”.

The recommendation drew a quick reaction from the coalition’s largest partner, ODM, which has asked MPs allied to Mr Musyoka’s party to relinquish parliamentary offices and House committee memberships, which they got courtesy of the 2017 arrangement. In the interview with Sunday Nation, Mr Musyoka reiterated that Nasa is dysfunctional as its Summit, which brings together all the leaders of the five parties forming the coalition, has not met since the 2017 elections were concluded. The coalition’s management committee has not met since, too.

The Wiper leader appeared to blame Mr Odinga and his ODM party of engineering the collapse of Nasa by refusing to attend key organ meetings, ostensibly to run away from sharing political parties funds with coalition partners.

“The critical issue had we met would have been to work out a formula for sharing funds from the Political Parties Fund. We did various things to try to have the meeting. I remember the four us — myself, Musalia Mudavadi, Isaac Ruto and Moses Wetang’ula — coming together to ask our friend in ODM to convene. But it did not work out. Now, if you cannot have a meeting of the leadership of a coalition, then there cannot be an effective coalition,” he said.

He added that the Nasa coalition management team, which is the other organ, has not been meeting as the ODM representative has not been showing up. Membership of the management team comprised Minority Leader of the Senate James Orengo for ODM, Johnson Muthama (that time for Wiper), Dr Eseli Simiyu for Ford-Kenya, Sakwa Bunyasi for ANC, and the CCM representative.

Mr Musyoka wondered whether ODM’s refusal to honour key meetings of the coalition was a way for Mr Odinga’s party to run away from a clause in the agreement that the orange party does not field a candidate in 2022.

Though Mr Odinga has not himself said so openly, his elder brother Dr Oburu Oginga and other ODM figures have said he will have a final shot at the presidency.

“We have not bowed out of the 2022 race. We don’t see any person who can pose a challenge to Raila and that is why we are saying, let him be president, even if for just one term,” Dr Oginga said early this month. On his coalition plans with Jubilee, Mr Musyoka said Wiper wants to work with President Kenyatta because of his commitment in the fight against graft, uniting the country following on the post-election handshake with Raila, and leaving a lasting legacy via the Big Found Agenda.

He, however, said Mr Ruto is not a factor in the coalition talks as their “minds were focused on President Uhuru Muigai Kenyatta”.

“There was no mention whatsoever of William Ruto because we assumed that the DP is under Uhuru Kenyatta. We are working with President Uhuru Kenyatta and that is it,” he said.

On the growing opposition in his Ukambani backyard, led by Governors Kivutha Kibwana (Makueni), Charity Ngilu (Kitui) and Alfred Mutua (Machakos), Mr Musyoka dismissively said he is “used to these voices” and suggested that the three governors were of little political consequence

Governors Kibwana and Mutua have declared their interests in running for the Presidency in the 2022 elections and have separately been critical of Mr Musyoka.

On the other hand, Ms Ngilu’s on-off relationship with Mr Musyoka soured recently following her attempted impeachment by MCAs in Kitui. Ms Ngilu has accused Mr Musyoka, Kitui Senator Enock Wambua and Kitui County Assembly Speaker George Ndotto of being the sponsors of the impeachment motion.

“I want to tell you that in 2013 and 2017 the same voices were against me running with Raila, but what was the outcome? The Kamba nation voted more for Raila than even the Luos. There will always be people who say they also want to be president. You cannot deny them the right to shout. That would be very unfair,” said Mr Musyoka.

On Ms Ngilu’s accusation that he was behind the failed impeachment motion, Mr Musyoka said that the governor is looking for an excuse “after failing in her job”.

Mr Musyoka also said the decision by former Machakos Senator Muthama to move to Dr Ruto’s camp was regrettable, but he has no ill feelings despite the latter having rejecting the Wiper party’s nomination to defend his Machakos seat in the 2017 elections and declaring that he would only campaign for Mr Odinga and not Wiper party. "
Walter Menya,"Until the recent announcement that the government had finally decided to withdraw altogether from the planned Sh1.64 billion purchase of high capacity buses for use in the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system, the only constant thing about the project has been the shifting narrative.

Launched in April 2018 with the marking of lanes along the Thika superhighway, the message from the Transport ministry has kept evolving from the buses arriving in a matter of days, to sourcing them from South Africa and later from both foreign firms and locally and to the uncertainty over who was going to run the buses.

Officials even went as far as visiting South Africa and posing for pictures with buses that were reportedly almost ready to be delivered to Nairobi

In January 2019, Transport Cabinet Secretary James Macharia was promising that the buses would be in the country the following month. ""We have made progress on bus rapid transport and have agreed with key stakeholders on their roll-out, which is expected later in February,"" Mr Macharia said on January 28 as he also announced the concept of car-free days in Nairobi. When February arrived, there was no clarity as to when the buses would arrive. February was when the CS had promised the first batch of the buses would have arrived.

This time, however, his PS Charles Hinga said procurement for the vehicles was still ongoing in South Africa. “The procurement process is ongoing, you will be furnished with all the information when the process is complete,” he said. This time there were no timelines given.

By June 2019, when the buses ought to have been on the road, the narrative changed from the arrival of the 64 high-capacity buses to the Transport ministry setting up a special company to operate the buses. “We are forming a special company to run and manage the buses. All stakeholders will be represented,” Mr Macharia was then quoted saying on June 11, 2019.

At that time also, instead of all the 64 buses being bought from South Africa, only 32 were reportedly being imported while the other half were to be procured locally. This followed protests by local companies who were aggrieved at being overlooked for the lucrative tender.

Several days later, there were media reports that instead of importing the vehicles from South Africa, now preference was to be given to local firms to supply the buses. “We are committed to engaging local manufacturing and assembling capacity in provision of these buses and pushing for policies that encourage private sector-led investments in the automotive and transport sectors. We have no intention or desire to import these buses from South Africa,” Mr Macharia said.

“As government, we have a duty to support the local manufacturing industry — so it will be impractical to fly these buses from South Africa yet they can be assembled locally,” he said. Initially, the reason for wanting to bring the vehicles from South Africa was that the local firms had not met the specifications given by the ministry.

In September 2019 when the buses ought to have been on the roads for some seven months, the Cabinet secretary told Parliament that the Ministry of Transport was planning to construct a Sh5.8 billion special lane for high-capacity buses along Thika Road comprising a station, four-foot bridges as well as a park and ride facility.

It suggests that the much-hyped BRT was a cart-before-horse move as the city was ill-prepared to roll out the system without the necessary infrastructure on the targeted roads.

The Sh.5.8 billion tender to construct the infrastructure for BRT was awarded to a Chinese firm, Stecol Corporation, two weeks ago.

No sooner had the government signed the contract with Stecol than Mr Hinga said it had withdrawn from the planned purchase of the BRT buses. In withdrawing, Mr Hinga told the Nation that the government had not paid for the buses that had already been branded in South Africa and was pulling out of the plan due to budgetary constraints.

“The buses had not been paid for. We were in the process of negotiating for them as the government planned to buy the first buses for the pilot phase to provide leadership in the new public transport model. We ran into budget constraints and will be engaging the private sector to purchase the buses as we focus on infrastructure,” PS Hinga said.

BRT was a product of the 2012 urban transport strategy to enhance public transport by prioritising the development of the Mass Rapid Transit System (MRTS).

 President Uhuru Kenyatta launched the BRT project in 2015, though there was little movement in actualising it with the government citing budgetary constraints. "
Walter Menya,"First, congratulations on being conferred the rank of Senior Counsel. What does this mean to you?

I think it is a recognition of my longevity in practice. This is my 41st year. I signed the roll of advocates on October 16, 1979. I should have done it in 1978 but I left the country after I had done my bar exams at the Kenya School of Law for Cyprus for my post-graduate management course.

I have always taken my annual practising certificate even when as a Cabinet minister I could not go to court, but I kept my law firm. One time I was operating from Church House as SK Musyoka & Company Advocates, another time I joined with other friends to found Musyoka Wambua Katiku. Now I have been practising as Musyoka Murambi & Associates.

According to the Nasa coalition agreement, Raila Odinga was expected to support your presidential bid in 2022. Will that happen? Do you smell betrayal by Raila and other Nasa principals?

I have been betrayed before and I don’t want to go into the politics of betrayal. I like to look more positively to the future because, just as they say in business, you don’t get what you deserve; you get what you negotiate.

There is no sense of entitlement here By the way, the coalition agreement does not say that ODM will support Wiper. What it says is that ODM in 2022 will not present a candidate for president. You cannot just assume that since I was the deputy to Raila, then ODM has to support me.

These things have to be done expressly, which is what we have done under a separate arrangement that I am not free to disclose at this stage. The arrangement is between Raila and I and not with the other parties in Nasa. I am not free to talk about it because it is a highly confidential matter.

At some point after the 2017 elections, it looked like you were gravitating towards Deputy President William Ruto’s corner and there were reports of the two of you working together towards the 2022 elections. Is this still the case?

That was completely untrue. It was purely speculative. You can take it as authoritative what I have just said. Wiper has stated that because of President Uhuru’s commitment in the fight against graft, uniting the country following on the post-election handshake with Raila, and looking at the way he is committed to leaving a lasting legacy in terms of Vision 2030 and therefore the Big Found Agenda, the Wiper NEC decided to support President Uhuru Kenyatta and his government.

Our mind was focused on President Uhuru Muigai Kenyatta. There was no mention whatsoever of William Ruto because we assumed that William Ruto is under Uhuru Kenyatta. If there are other machinations in between, Kalonzo Musyoka is as open, as I have always been. That speculation must be belonging to the underworld politics. We are working with President Uhuru Kenyatta, and that is it.

Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu has accused you and County Assembly Speaker George Ndotto of being behind failed impeachment attempts against her. What do you have to say to this?

I think the starting point is that governors must accept to be oversighted. When MCAs, exercising their constitutional mandate of oversight, decide to hold governors accountable, people should not use people like me as the fall guys to cover for every sin they commit. I refuse completely to be drawn into that kind of agenda because it is mischievous and misconceived. I don’t engage in such kind of dirty politics. When the MCAs decided that they were going to take the impeachment move, they never consulted me. I actually saw the elaborate charges in the media. I have no role in running the affairs of the County Assembly of Kitui. As a matter of fact, I have never set foot in the County Assembly of Kitui or in the governor’s office even when (Julius) Malombe was the governor.

For a long time former Machakos Senator Johnstone Muthama was your close political associate, but then you seem to have fallen out in the run-up to the 2017 elections. What could have led to the falling out?

The party gave him a ticket in 2017 and he refused. He actually said he was going to campaign for Raila, not even for Wiper. Now I think he has chosen to campaign for Ruto. It is his constitutional right. There is nothing I can think of that made him take the decisions he has taken. There is nothing personal between me and Muthama. I think he just missed keeping his eyes on the ball because he used to say that he would not rest until I became president.

So what happened? There was this misconception that he used to fund the party. Far from it. If anything, there are people who have benefited from my being who I was as vice president and party leader. We don’t know who they were approaching and cutting deals with using my name. Others have been selling me to the highest bidders. This time I will negotiate for myself. "
Walter Menya,"The afternoon of April 23 was to be a time for Tecra Muigai, 29 – daughter of Keroche Breweries directors Tabitha and Joseph Karanja – to reconnect and relax with friends.

Having been caught up in the lockdown in Lamu where she had gone to visit her boyfriend Omar Lali Omar “for a weekend”, she ended up remaining there for more than 40 days. Tecra initially stayed at Diamond Beach Hotel on Ras-Kitau Manda Island.

After 38 days at the hotel, she moved to Jaha Guest House in Shella village.

On that fateful day, Tecra had planned to host a group of friends between 3pm and 6pm in time for them to beat the curfew.

The party was never to be and Tecra would not see her friends again after she reportedly fell from a flight of stairs, according to her boyfriend Omar Lali Omar, 52, sustaining serious injuries. She died at Nairobi Hospital on May 2.

On Thursday, the Director of Public Prosecutions made an about-turn and entered a nolle prosequi, thereby discontinuing the intended murder case against Mr Lali, just minutes before he was to take a plea.

The prosecution instead told the court that it favours a public inquest into Tecra’s death. Counsel Eric Kadebbe will lead the prosecution at the inquest whose details have yet to be announced.

Mr Lali had been arrested after Tecra’s death and spent 14 days in custody. He was then released on Sh300,000 cash bail.

When an inquest is finally convened, the difficult question that will have to be answered is whether this was murder or an accident.

“The case raises critical human rights and justice questions that must be answered. We pray that the inquest shall seek to illuminate the circumstances surrounding Tecra’s death. It should not end up like the past ones which failed to unravel the mysteries surrounding the deaths of the likes of Bishop Alexander Kipsang Muge, Julie Ward and Fr Kaiser,” Ms Ann Njogu, a social justice advocate and ambassador of the Africa Unite Campaign lobby, said.

In his statement to police and Tecra’s mother, Mr Lali maintained that his girlfriend fell off the stairs at Jaha House on April 23 at 5.30am.

Mr Lali added that he took her to Shella Dispensary before she was transferred to King Fahad Referral Hospital where she was admitted.

Tecra would be flown to Nairobi Hospital where she eventually died.

Soon after Mr Lali was freed, his lawyer, Yusuf Abubakar, said he always believed his client was innocent. However, reports of two pathologists have questioned the fall theory.

According to the postmortem, Tecra had multiple head injuries, all of which could not have been caused by a fall from a flight of stairs.

Government pathologist Johansen Oduor said the injuries were unlikely caused by a single impact.

“This observation indicates blunt object injury and as well as a possible fall,” Dr Oduor said in his report.

Another report by consultant pathologist Andrew Gachii made similar observations.

“Tecra allegedly fell from a height. However, the numerous head injuries…are unlikely to have been caused by a single impact. There are multiple impact sites as well as deep injuries, which suggest both blunt object blow injuries as well as a possible fall,” Dr Gachii concluded in his 14-page report.

“This is in view of noted highly complex injuries with focal and multi-focal pattern of injuries.”

Mr Lali had been represented by Prof Emily Rogena – a pathologist – at the postmortem

A toxicology examination found no alcohol in Tecra’s system as had been reported, according to a report seen by the Sunday Nation.

A housekeeper at Jaha Guest House had told the investigators that when he went to clean the house at 7.30am on the fateful day, he found no one but spotted a sizeable blood drop on the stairs base towards the second floor.

The Keroche Breweries heiress’ mobile phone and laptop were on the couch while the boyfriend’s was switched off. The caretaker said he reported the odd situation to the manager.

Mr Lali reportedly asked them to clean the blood and the rest of the house “since it was just a minor incident”.

Before the prosecution’s unexpected about-turn, the necessary preparations to charge Mr Lali had been made and that he was going to take a plea had not been in question.

He was transferred from Lamu to Garsen in Tana River County where there is a High Court and appeared before a judge who directed that he undergoes a mental assessment to ascertain if he is mentally fit to stand trial.

“This is one of the saddest and most tragic cases. It raises very many questions. If it is true that the toxicology reports are negative and did not find alcohol in her blood, who then was drunk on the night of the reported fall?” Ms Njogu asked.

“If it is true that Tecra sought to end her relationship with Lali and considering it is a fact that women are most at risk of femicide when attempting to do so, what could have happened on the material night of the alleged fall?”

The decision to charge Mr Lali with murder had been arrived at on the basis of a police investigation report that paints a portrait of an aggressive, possessive and jealous man who would often engage in fights and confrontation.

The report, according to police sources, also showed that Mr Lali largely depended on his girlfriend for upkeep.

Amidst the uncertainty of the circumstances under which Tecra died, claims of a love triangle involving a Dutch woman, and an overly possessive boyfriend have emerged to support the murder theory.

The inquest will likely dwell into this theory too. The Dutch woman had been in Naivasha sometime between January and February, around the same time Mr Lali was with Tecra at her apartment in town.  The Dutch woman and her daughter were at Naivasha Rocky Eco Lodge before she travelled to Lamu.

Shortly after, Mr Lali too left for Lamu and Tecra followed him. Tecra travelled back to Naivasha for work-related meetings then went back to Lamu.

The next time she left Lamu, Tecra was unconscious and on an Amref aircraft to Nairobi Hospital.

Mr Lali and his lawyer deny claims of murder. 

“My client has not been happy since he was accused of killing the woman he loved and whom he had some plans with, but he is happy today,” Mr Abubakar had said after the prosecution entered a nolle prosequi.

Mr Lali is reported to have five daughters from three marriages – one from the Coast, a Briton and a Dutch. "
Walter Menya,"The timing could not have been better. As the busy Christmas period was kicking in, the Energy and Petroleum Regulatory (EPRA) in November 2019 announced new profit margins for petroleum products retailers.

The regulator raised the retail operations margin per litre of fuel from Sh3 to Sh4.14.

But hardly six months later, the promise of enhanced profits has all but diminished as retailers battle with the giant oil marketers and EPRA over the former’s decision to unilaterally introduce new charges that have wiped out the Sh1.14 increment they had received in November 2019, and even more.

For the retailers under the umbrella of the Kenya National Petroleum Dealers Association (KENAPEDE), EPRA has become nothing more than a bystander, watching as the giant multinational oil marketers disregard the regulations on the profit margins by introducing new charges that are also not covered by Marketing License Agreements (MLAs). The dispute is now the subject of judicial review proceedings at the High Court as retailers seek to have the court compel EPRA to enforce its laws and regulations.

“The applicant submits that the 2nd respondent (EPRA) has by its action to ignore the ex parte applicant’s grievances contained in its several letters amounts to a breach of its statutory duty towards the applicant who is a stakeholder in the petroleum industry, and the failure to address its grievances has caused its members to suffer through being subjected to low retail operating margins due to manipulations by the oil marketing companies,” the association says.

The dispute over profit margins is one among several issues the retailers on the one hand, and oil marketing companies and EPRA on the other, have locked horns.

For instance, retailers have also accused the regulator of failing to take action on fuel losses during delivery of up to 350 litres per order, and complaints over intimidation by oil marketing companies.

EPRA did not respond when Sunday Nation reached out to them. In the particular case of profit margins, the retailers say that oil marketing companies came up with new charges such as working capital charge, Health Safety, Environment and Quality (HSEQ) charge, digital charge, research and development, training and assistance charge and through-put charge.

They say that before EPRA’s announcement of November 14, there were no such charges.



According to the court papers, the oil marketing companies have been trying to regularise the illegal charges by coercing the dealers to sign amendments to the existing dealership marketing license agreements.

“Even though in theory the members of the ex parte applicant seem to be receiving the prescribed margins, the oil marketing companies by introduction of these new charges through the back door are exploiting the margins as the members have to provide for these charges from their margins,” the association says.

As a result, they say that retailers have been getting margins as low as Sh3 per litre, contrary to the Sh4.14 prescribed by EPRA in the new regulations published in November 2019.

The matter will be coming up for mention on Tuesday.

Petroleum price controls started in December 2010 when the maximum margin per litre was set at Sh6 at wholesale and Sh3 at the retail level. The margins remained at the same level until November 2019.

The margins remain constant whether fuel prices rise or drop as set by EPRA every month. "
Walter Menya,"The 2022 succession and the ‘handshake’ politics loom large over the Senate as it meets tomorrow to thrash out an agreeable formula for revenue sharing among counties. At stake is how to share Sh316 billion across the 47 counties.

Concerns that Deputy President William Ruto and his allies could exploit the disaffection of the political leaders of the historically marginalised counties with the formula to draw them to his camp ahead of the 2022 elections will be weighing heavily on the Senate.

Besides what the Deputy President might be thinking is the dilemma for President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga on how to balance the argument that the formula takes away resources from the historically marginalised counties while giving the well-endowed and highly populated counties more money, and keeping to the recommendations of the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) to increase the resources to the counties by at least 35 per cent. The President’s central Kenya backyard, which has been complaining about the current revenue allocation formula as biased, are pushing for the adoption of the proposed formula, adding to the President’s headache.

President Kenyatta had on Thursday given Senate Majority Leader Samuel Poghisio three days to resolve the standoff on the formula. At State House when he assented to six pieces of legislation, the President was reportedly not happy with the failure of the Senate to end the impasse. It was after the State House meeting on Thursday that Mr Poghisio started mobilising senators to sign up in support of having a special Senate sitting on Monday.

Amid the political concerns, the Sunday Nation has learnt of behind-the-scenes manoeuvres to introduce amendments, including for instance retaining the parameters as proposed by the Commission on Revenue Allocation (CRA) while setting aside 15 per cent of the equitable share to cushion the counties that will be negatively affected by the adoption of the new formula.

Narok Senator Ledama Olekina, who has made the proposal, has been meeting with Senate Majority Whip Irungu Kang’ata as they explore possible compromise areas to appease the frontier counties including those at the Coast and northern Kenya. Ahead of the Monday special sitting of the Senate, political leaders from the north eastern counties who are opposed to the formula proposed by the CRA have already warned that together with other expansive arid and semi-arid (Asal) counties, they will rethink their support for the Building Bridges Initiative and the proposed referendum if their concerns over the formula are not addressed.

“If this discriminatory formula is implemented, leaders from these 18 counties will find it difficult to convince the public to support important government agendas such as BBI and the referendum because it will be hard to tell the people that the same government that reduced their revenues is the same government that is asking for their support of its critical agendas,” they said.

Surprisingly, among those who endorsed the statement is Garissa Senator Yusuf Haji, who chairs the BBI committee that has been working on proposed constitutional, legislative, policy and administrative reforms.

The statement was signed by governors Ali Korane (Garissa), Mohamed Abdi (Wajir), Mohamud Ali (Marsabit), and Ali Roba (Mandera), as well as senators Haji (Garissa), Farhiya Haji Ali (nominated), Dr Ali Ibrahim (Wajir) and Hargura Godana.

The north-eastern counties are banking on the support of a number of counties at the Coast, lower eastern, and other pastoralist regions, which historically have been marginalised. Those marginalised include eight that are Muslim-dominated.

Kilifi Senator Stewart Madzayo has also hinted at regions currently supporting the President and Mr Odinga changing political course if the formula is passed as it is.

“Let it be known here and now that if there is going to be any political falling-out, it will be because of our failure to agree on how to share resources, mainly financial,” he said. The special sitting of the Senate will take place two days before the National Assembly also holds a similar sitting to consider, among others, the formula and County Allocation of Revenue Bill, 2020, both as passed by the Senate.

Senate Minority Whip Mutula Kilonzo Junior told the Sunday Nation that the special sitting is expected to be preceded by a senators’ Kamukunji (informal meeting) where they hope to thrash out any contentious issues before the formal sitting.

The special meeting was gazetted on Friday evening after frantic efforts by the Senate leaders to get the support of senators.

“It was a challenge. Most people wanted a Kamkunji first,” Senator Kilonzo said.

Article 217 (1) of the constitution mandates the Senate to determine the basis for allocating resources among the counties the share of national revenue once every five years.

Without the third basis formula, the Sh316 billion allocated to counties in 2020/21 financial year as equitable shareable revenue can’t be shared from July 1, as it will be unconstitutional.

The proposed formula has adopted a sector-specific funding approach and it places focus on the performance and pressure of the population on specific sectors, fiscal discipline and accountability and revenue performance.

The health sector has been assigned a weight of 15 per cent. The commission combined the uninsured, inpatient and outpatient parameters to come up with the index. In the agriculture sector, it calculated the total number of rural households and their extension services and food security needs to determine the proposed 10 per cent weight. Population has been weighted 18 per cent from 45 per cent in the current formula while poverty has a weight of 14 per cent from the current 18 per cent.

For the Asal counties, giving prominence to population and relegating land will disadvantage them while the relatively small but heavily populated counties benefit at their expense. The northern Kenya political leaders, for instance, argue that the eight Muslim counties – Wajir, Mandera, Marsabit, Tana River, Garissa, Mombasa, Kwale and Kilifi - stand to lose over Sh11.3 billion if the new formula is adopted.

“Any formula that reduces allocation to counties should not be allowed without cushioning those that are negatively impacted by the new formula. Besides the timing is very wrong because of the economic difficulties within the counties as a result of Covid-19 pandemic,” the north eastern region political leaders said.

For Mr Poghisio, the choices he has are tough. As West Pokot senator, his county could be among those to be negatively impacted by the formula yet he still has to support government business in the Senate.

Kirinyaga Senator Charles Kibiru, who chairs the Senate Finance and Budget Committee, however says that the proposed formula has come to correct the revenue-sharing anomalies that existed since the advent of devolution seven years ago. “We have people who have enjoyed some advantage over the rest of the country for the last seven years but we are now trying to normalise the situation. With this formula, we are trying to minimise the per capita gap that has existed. There is no formula that will make everybody happy,” he told the Sunday Nation.

But he acknowledged that it is not possible to ignore the BBI and 2022 political undertones from the debate on the formula.

“There is a lot of lobbying for and against the formula. There could be amendments,” he said.

For Senator Kilonzo, BBI and 2022 succession politics have influence on the Monday special sitting.

“How will Raila, for example, explain to his supporters in the Coast region why they should lose resources while other ODM strongholds gain and still expect to retain their loyalty?” posed Mr Kilonzo.

Since the advent of devolution, the formula for sharing revenue among counties has always remained heavily contested. For instance, in 2016, Kiambu Senator Kimani Wamatangi challenged the current formula in court, alleging it was discriminatory but lost the case at the constitutional court. "
Walter Menya,"A tender for the pre-export inspection of used motor vehicles coming to Kenya is a lucrative business. At a minimum of $155 (Sh16,500) per vehicle, the tender has over the years attracted fierce and dirty bidder wars, often with the staff of Kenya Bureau of Standards (Kebs) allegedly in the thick of it.

So, when Kebs on December 3, 2019 decided to increase the number of firms providing the Pre-Export Verification of Conformity (PVoC) of standards services for used motor vehicles, mobile equipment and spare parts, it created a storm of controversy.

Quality Inspection Services Japan (QISJ), which had been the sole contractor for the nearly Sh1.5 billion a year tender, was aggrieved that new firms were being brought on board when it had an ongoing contract that ends in April 2021 and quietly protested. Attorney-General Paul Kihara cautioned Kebs that varying existing contracts, as it seemed to have been the case, could expose the bureau to huge losses as a result of litigation. Kebs’ own lawyers, Iseme Kamau and Maema Advocates, had advised that it be stopped for fear of exposing the standards’ agency to huge costs.

Meanwhile, the Public Investments Committee (PIC) of the National Assembly’s advice that Kebs should withhold awarding of the contracts for the expanded tender to EAA Company Limited and Auto-Terminal Japan (ATJ) until a special audit of the two firms the committee, was considering is over was ignored.

Amid all these have been several allegations of corruption in the expansion of the tender to the ATJ and EAA. The brief arrest on Thursday of Kebs managing director Lt Col (rtd) Bernard Njiraini over allegations of obstructing investigations by the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) now threatens to expose the decisions and alleged under-the-table deals that went on in the award of the tender to ATJ and EAA.

Mr Njiraini was arrested on Thursday by EACC on accusation of frustrating investigations by failing or refusing to comply with orders to supply the agency with original documents related to the awards for tenders for the provision of pre-export conformity of goods, used motor vehicles, mobile equipment and spare parts, the commission said in a statement.

He has not been charged and EACC sources said he was released conditionally on the undertaking that he will henceforth comply with the commission’s requests.

A glimpse into the allegations of corruption in the award of the PVOC tender for used motor vehicles, mobile equipment, and spare parts are contained in a letter the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA) wrote to KEBS on April 21, 2020, about a month after the contracts were awarded, as part of the investigation the Authority was undertaking. The letter, which has been presented as an investigation report, arose out of two complaints from an unnamed whistleblower and Niavana Agencies Ltd, who had unsuccessfully challenged the decision to award the expanded contracts before the Public Procurement Administrative Review Board (PPARB).

However, EAA moved to court to stop PPRA from proceeding with the investigations on grounds that the same issues had been raised before the Public Procurement Administrative Review Board and were also still the subject of High Court Judicial Review Application No. 66 of 2020. Justice Pauline Nyamweya granted the stay order sought by EAA on April 30.

In the contested preliminary investigation, a copy of which Sunday Nation has obtained, PPRA had noted several irregularities that Kebs was to respond to within seven days.

For instance, as per the criteria set out by Kebs, all the three firms that submitted their bids were not responsive at the preliminary evaluation stage. Three firms had submitted bids, namely ATJ, EAA, and Nippon Inspection Centre Ltd. For example, ATJ, which was one of the two firms eventually awarded the contract, was found to have failed to meet the requirement to provide a copy of the certificate of incorporation. For its United Kingdom unit, the certificate of incorporation it provided showed that it deals in motor vehicle repairs, which amounted to a conflict of interest given the nature of works KEBS was seeking.

EAA, on the other hand, among others, failed in the requirement for copies of relevant government licenses, some of which were found to have failed to conform to the requirements.

While Nippon Inspection Centre Ltd was dropped at the preliminary stage, EAA, and ATJ advanced to the technical evaluation stage despite the noted irregularities.

At the technical evaluation, PPRA found that EAA and ATJ had again been unresponsive after failing to provide all the information regarding their presence and location to provide the required services in the UK, Japan, UAE, Thailand, South Africa, and Singapore. In some instances, they failed to provide lease or tenancy agreements and in at least one case, the lease agreement provided was unsigned.

At the financial evaluation stage, PPRA noted that contrary to the requirement that the form for tender be completed, signed and stamped, both companies’ forms were not stamped.

The Authority had also observed that the procurement plan which KEBS relied on to procure the services was prepared on January 2, 2020, a whole month after the invitation to tender. According to PPRA, this was contrary to Section 69(2) which provides that a procurement plan cannot be used retrospectively.

Moreover, PPRA noted the plan used by KEBS had not been approved by the National Standards Council. “The procurement plan did not have an estimated value and an indication of the budget available and the sources of funding and the choice of procurement method for the enlargement of the provision of pre-export verification Pre-Export Verification of Conformity (PVoC) to standards for used motor vehicles, mobile equipment and spare parts, as provided for in Section 53(10) of the Act as required by Regulations 21(1f&g) of PPDR 2006,” PPRA stated in the letter.

Other irregularities noted were that KEBS did not include indicative or approved budgets for the tender and that the process was done without a purchase requisition as required by law.

“Taking cognisance of the above findings and observations, it is in the opinion of the authority that the subject procurement did not meet the requirements set forth in the tender document, Public Procurement and Asset Disposal Act, 2015, and the Regulations issued under the repealed Public Procurement and Disposal Act 2005 pursuant to section 24 of the Interpretation and General Provisions Act,” PPRA stated in the letter.

Kebs told Sunday Nation that they had responded to the letter and explained to the Authority the issues it had raised. The bureau, however, said they could not share the response as it would not be in line with government procedures.

The tender is also subject to at least two other court matters by Niavana Agencies and activist Okiya Omtatah.

For pre-export inspection services, both EAA and ATJ charge $155 (Sh16,500) for every vehicle coming from Japan, $225 (Sh24,000) for the UK and South Africa, $192 (Sh20,400) for UAE, and $250 (Sh26,600) for Thailand and Singapore. Of the amounts, KEBS gets $45 (Sh4,795) per vehicle as administration fees paid monthly.

According to a report by PIC, 91,179 motor vehicles were imported to Kenya in 2019, up from 87,739 brought into the country in 2018. QISJ had been the sole inspection agency for KEBS between those years before the field was expanded to include EAA and ATJ.

Walter Menya,"Experts appointed by President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga to the Building Bridges Initiative Committee have been unable to agree on a number of contentious issues as the deadline for the team’s work draws closer.

The restructuring of the Judicial Service Commission (JSC), the place of other constitutional commissions, granting Nairobi County a special status and the economic model for the country have generated heated debate within the committee and their team of experts.

The BBI team, now formally known as the Steering Committee on the Implementation of the Building Bridges to a United Kenya Task Force, had hoped to have the final report ready after its retreat two weeks ago.

However, that was not possible as the committee and the team of experts could not agree on the contentious issues. The retreat was held at Safari Park Hotel along Thika Highway.

In fact, one of the joint secretaries of the committee, Mr Martin Kimani, had indicated the committee would have a report ready after the retreat ahead of June 30, when their mandate expires.

After the first retreat failed to resolve the contentious issues, the committee is currently in Machakos County for a second retreat, hoping to iron out the issues and hand over its report and reform proposals by June 30.

The Steering Committee comprises Senator Yusuf Haji as the chairman and members Bishop Lawi Imathiu, Woman Rep Maison Leshomo, Mr James Matundura, Ms Rose Museu, Ms Agnes Kavindu Muthama, Prof Saeed Mwaguni, Bishop Peter Njenga, Archbishop Zacheaus Okoth, Prof Adams Oloo, Senator Amos Wako, Dr Florence Omose, Prof Morompi ole Ronkei and Major (Rtd) John Seii. The joint secretaries of the committee are Mr Kimani and lawyer Paul Mwangi.

The team of experts that has been working with the committee was appointed following the BBI task force’s recommendation for appointment of effective technical committees “to turn the report’s recommendations into the legal, policy and administrative measures required for implementation.”

On the JSC, the contention is on who should sit on the commission. A source within the team told the Saturday Nation that the debate to make the JSC more independent has revolved around two schools of thought: first that the commission is currently dominated by judicial officers, which in a bid to protect their own, has been reluctant to entertain complaints against judges and magistrates.

As currently constituted, judges and magistrates occupy five seats in the 11-member JSC.

A section of experts want this arrangement altered to have more “independent” outsiders in the commission. Those fronting this school of thought have also questioned why the Chief Justice should automatically chair the JSC.

This argument has the support of lawyer Nzamba Kitonga, who chaired the now defunct Committee of Experts (CoE) that midwifed the 2010 Constitution.

Mr Kitonga says the nomination of people to be appointed as judges of the Court of Appeal demonstrates why JSC should not be dominated by the Judiciary.



 “I think it was a mistake to recommend that JSC should be dominated by the judiciary. This (nomination of Court of Appeal judges) is one such reasons it should not be dominated by the judiciary,” said Mr Kitonga.

On the opposite side, the argument is that the JSC as it is currently has more than enough members representing the Executive, which puts at risk the independence of JSC and the Judiciary in general.

The Attorney-General, who is an appointee of the President, has an automatic seat in the commission as is the representative of the Public Service Commission, also an appointee of the President. In addition, the President appoints two non-lawyers to sit in the JSC as public representatives. That directly gives the Executive four votes in the commission.

The contention about granting Nairobi County a special status, as had been recommended by the BBI report, has been more about how it will work out without watering down the principle of devolution.

On the economic model, the task force report had noted that Kenyans were complaining of an economy that is exclusively controlled by a small elite and that there was need for a radical overhaul of the economic model.

“Obviously there are those who may not want the status quo – which gives them immense privileges – to change and there are those who wish to go by what Kenyans demanded,” a source said of the ongoing talks inside the Steering Committee’s retreat.

Ruth Mbula,"Non-teaching staff in public schools from six counties in Nyanza region have appealed to the government to pay their salaries for the months of July and August.

The staff from Migori, Homa Bay, Kisii, Kisumu, Nyamira and Siaya under the Nyanza Region Support Staff Welfare, converged in Kisii town Thursday to air their grievances.

The workers said they have not been paid for the two months despite some of them being on duty since the schools closed following the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic.

They said they have been subjected to untold suffering, including being unable to receive medical services due to non-remittance of National Hospital Insurance Fund dues. They also said that it has been difficult for them to provide basic needs like food and clothing to their families, besides being unable to pay house rent, a situation which has put most of them in a state of general depression.

“As per the Basic Education Act, 2013, it is the responsibility of the Ministry of Education to ensure availability of funds and payment of all salaries for the support staff as envisaged in the Personal Emoluments vote,” said Mr Evance Achar, the group’s coordinator.

Mr Achar said the Education ministry has not remitted funds for payment of salaries of the employees for July and August 2020.

“We are, therefore, humbly requesting the ministry to release the remaining capitation for personal emoluments to be used for paying the salary arrears of these employees, which will go a long way in solving their current problems,” said Ms Dorine Sunda, the group's secretary.

Ms Sunda said the funds recently released by the Ministry of Education were for the payment of board of management teachers only, leaving out non-teaching staff who have been on duty all through this period.

Teachers hired by school boards are receiving stipends from the Sh1.72 billion Covid-19 relief kitty. Education Chief Administrative Secretary Zack Kinuthia recently said that only those who were working by March 15 when the government ordered the closure of schools will be paid.

Mr Kinuthia said the money has already been set aside by the National Treasury as per the advice of the Ministry of Education and that it would be sent to banks this morning (Thursday).

Education Principal Secretary Belio Kipsang told the Nation that the funds have been cleared for release after the ministry verified the lists of 43,000 beneficiaries submitted by headteachers.

The teachers have gone without pay since March when schools were closed due to Covid-19.

Mr Kinuthia said delays in paying the teachers were caused by reports of plans by some headteachers to steal the funds.

The CAS, who spoke while on a tour of Murang’a County, said the dubious scheme had seen the number of beneficiaries inflated to 126,000.

He said that among the tricks some headteachers employed were using names of serving and retired teachers as well as dead ones, friends outside the teaching profession, and board members listed as instructors.

He said the budget to pay the teachers is part of the Sh15.4 billion the government has set aside for public schools to enable them prepare for reopening."
Ruth Mbula,"Kisii town, once a one-lane shopping centre with countable buildings, surrounded by steep, heavily forested hills, has progressively grown into a buzzing business centre - the second fastest growing town in Nyanza region after Kisumu.

Kisii was originally known as Getembe. It was a small beer market that got conquered by the British in the late 19th century.

To the northwest of the busy, and sometimes extremely cacophonous town, lies Kiamwasi hill, the home of Otenyo Nyamacharaa, a young man who speared to death the first Kisii district commissioner, who represented the colonial governor on behalf of the Queen of England. 

The killing of the DC provoked a vicious and brutal attack by a contingent of colonial forces, with the support of home guards.

After the brutal killing of Otenyo, whose grave has never been located, Getembe was renamed what it is now – Bosongo -- the land of the white. 

The construction of an administrative centre near Milimani area and a police station in the centre of town started off the gradual growth of the now expansive town in the highlands east of Lake Victoria.

Before Bosongo became the acceptable business and administrative centre, Boindi, modern-day Riana had become the largest trading centre in South Kavirondo, as Gusii was politically described, following a large group of Indians who found the area conducive for business.

The name Boindi was in reference to the Indians, who were the first to set up businesses in Riana.

Mr Thomas Oresi, who has witnessed the growth of the town from his childhood days up until he served as a councillor for five terms in the late 1970s, said devolution had hastened development. 

The 82-year-old Oresi said Indians, Arabs and the British played a big role in the growth of the town.

Rangi Mbili, owned by Arabs, is one of the oldest buildings in town. It reminds residents of the humble beginnings of the town that is now the headquarters of Kisii County.

“Kisii is known as the land of bananas and has in the past seven years of devolution registered tremendous growth. The Rangi Mbili building reminds us how far we have come,” said Mr Oresi. The town got its first tarmac road less than two decades ago but now has several well-constructed roads.

“In the early 80s, we had one murram lane with the Rangi Mbili building being very prominent,” said Mr Oresi.

Most shops, he says, were made of iron sheets, with the Indians and Arabs living behind their shops. “The whites, who were mostly commissioners and missionaries lived in Milimani estate, which explains why it is still associated with the rich,” said Mr Oresi.

He added: “I was among the first natives to own a shop, which I bought from an Indian.”

The Oresi Sub-county Hospital is named after Mr Oresi for the contribution he made to the health sector in his younger days as an ambulance driver. 

“Back the it was prestigious to drive an ambulance and natives as well as the whites trusted me to supply of drugs,” said Mr Oresi.

After the indigenous population started taking over the town in the early 1970s, they encroached on road reserves, which has led to congestion as residents fight for the little available space in the wake of a population explosion.

Mr Oresi’s narration of the town’s growth is corroborated by several economic reports, including the World Bank’s.

The growth is attributed to a combination of factors, such as a conducive climate for economic investment and the strategic location of the town on the highway to Uganda and Tanzania.

A report by the United Kingdom-based Sustainable Urban Economic Development in 2019 ranked Kisii town among the 12 fastest-growing municipalities in Kenya.

Although the town prides itself with growth, economic experts warn that competition for limited resources, such as land, threatens the future stability of the town.

Additionally, the lack of sufficient room for expansion puts the town in jeopardy because existing social amenities will be stretched to accommodate the fast-growing population. The town faces serious challenges as the land continues to shrink. According to the 2019 census, Kisii County has a population of 1.2 million.

Kisii is among 12 municipalities in which Sustainable Urban Economic Development (Sued) carries out various development programmes.

The programme is funded by the United Kingdom's department of International Development (DFID) and aims at supporting the 12 fast-growing municipalities in Kenya to develop sustainable urban development and economic plans for critical infrastructure.

Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) Governor, Patrick Njoroge, in a past interview said the bank will open a currency centre in Kisii to ease the distribution of cash to financial institutions. Its construction is almost complete. 

Dr Njoroge said the decision was informed by high cash circulation in Kisii town, which is expected to serve parts of Rift Valley and Nyanza region. CBK has three branches in Mombasa, Kisumu and Eldoret. 

Kisii Governor James Ongwae said the town's growth has placed it t a strategic place in Nyanza region. “Kisii is a cash-rich area and my administration has helped create a conducive environment for investors who have contributed a lot in the county’s economy,” said Mr Ongwae.

More than 10 Level Four health facilities operate within the town alone while others are located in the outskirts.

The new private-owned hospitals have helped decongest the public Kisii Teaching and Referral Hospital, serving about six million people in Kisii, Nyamira, Trans Mara and parts of Bomet, Migori, Kericho and Homa Bay counties.

The increase in health providers has led to more specialists in the region and the communities now rarely seek specialised medical services outside the county.

There are also more than 20 institutions of higher education in Kisii, including public and private universities.

The town also has a vibrant night life with dozens of hotels located in the town. Members of the Gusii community in the diaspora have invested heavily in real estate, putting up high-rise apartments.

Dr Matunda Nyanchama, who lived in the US and Canada, serving at one time as chairman of the Abagusii community in the diaspora a few years ago, attributed the fast-paced growth of Kisii town to the heavy investment in property by members of the Abagusii community in the diaspora.

He said 40 per cent of Sh117 billion shillings remitted by Kenyans in the diaspora each year ends up in the county, and that more than half of this is invested in real estate.

Devolution has also spurred Kisii's growth with the county government spending millions of shillings in developing the town.

The World Bank, as well as other organisations are also partnering with the county government to help improve the status of Kisii municipality.

Under devolution, Gusii Stadium has undergone a major facelift, making it suitable for hosting major sporting events in the country.

Street lighting and tarmacking of various roads has also greatly transformed the town.

Roads linking Kisii Police Station with several banks, supermarkets, churches, the Kisii Level Six Hospital and Falcon junction are now in good condition, thanks to the upgrade."
Ruth Mbula,"The mention of Fr Lawrence Nyaanga’s name sends shivers down the spines of illicit brew makers and their clients in Kisii town and its environs.  

The Catholic priest is feared by chang’aa, kangara and busaa traders for his persistence in pursuing and using the police to crack down on illicit drinks.

However, he has won accolades from residents who do not support consumption of illicit liquor.

As result of his fight against the illicit brews, a group of criminals was once deployed to his residence in Nyabururu Catholic Parish to eliminate him.

Fr Nyaanga, who is also a chaplain at Kisii University, says his fight against the illicit brews has also earned him a bad name among police officers, chiefs and their assistants, some of whom receive bribes from the brewers.

Appointed to the university in 2012, he has helped in transforming the lives of young people who abuse drugs. “I was ordained in 1989 and I have spent most of my years in priesthood protecting the lives of young people,” said the ecumenical specialist, a concept and principle by Christians of different church traditions and denominations to develop closer relationships and better unity between other traditions and denominations.

His efforts have seen him join the Alcohol Drug Abuse (Ada) Board, which closely works with the National Authority for Campaign against Alcohol and Drug Abuse (Nacada).

“Ada has a performance contract with Nacada. We keep reporting what we are doing to curb consumption of illicit brews and drug abuse in our community,” said Fr Nyaanga.

Two years ago, he paid a heavy price for his sustained campaign against the illicit brews.

Out of the blue, a man threw a cup full of kangara on his face as he went about his business at Kiamabundu area in Nyaribari Chache constituency.

He survived without injuries, with the assault only doubling his resolve to take on the brewers. Alcohol and drugs have been blamed for many ills in society, including health complications such as blindness, breakdown of families and decline in economic productivity of addicted individuals.

The nature of his campaign has forced him to work closely with community policing members, some of whom are members of the outlawed Sungusungu group.

“My aim is to partner with those we share similar values and strategies in the fight against illicit brews and drugs abuse,” Fr Nyaanga said.

Cartels in the illicit brewing industry, he observes, conspire with those in authority to buy their freedom once arrested and return to the villages and resume their illegal business with utmost impunity.

“We have cartels comprising the police, chiefs and their assistants, community policing members and court clerks,” he said. Some assistant county commissioners and deputy county commissioners in various parts of the country receive bribes from chiefs to offer protection to the brewers.

“The brewers are well-connected. Nothing scares them,” Fr Nyaanga said.

The corruption extends to courts where some probation officers give false reports to the courts about offenders after being bribed in order to receive non-custodial punishments.

“We have some police officers owning kiosks in town where illicit brew confiscated from offenders is packed well and sold. They now call the alcoholic drinks sanitiser,"" he said.

The priest said the blame game between different authorities has made the war on illicit liquor very difficult.

“But residents appear to be slowly getting tired of notorious brewers,” said Fr Nyaanga.

“I am happy that I have made positive impact on many lives.” "
Ruth Mbula,"The mystery around the recent fire at the Kisii County Assembly has deepened after Kenya Power Company said the inferno was caused by arsonists.

The company has further dismissed claims by the county leadership that the fire, which razed down a section of the county premises, was triggered by an electric fault. The company now wants thorough investigations into the incident.

Kenya Power Company's statement came even as some MCAs refuted claims that vital documents were destroyed by the fire.

The fire left MCAs with no chambers to transact house business. The county assembly building also houses the county government offices.

According to Kenya Power's regional manager in charge of South Nyanza, Mr Kennedy Ogalo, preliminary investigations showed that the Friday afternoon fire had nothing to do with any fault from the power supply system.

Mr Ogalo said investigations by the company has revealed systematic interference with their transformer.

Mr Ogalo, who covers Kisii, Nyamira, Migori and Homa Bay counties, said when they received news of the fire incident, the firm’s management immediately deployed technicians to the ground and soon established interference with their transformer.

Kisii Governor James Ongwae and county assembly Speaker David Kombo had earlier on dismissed foul play and stated that no documents were destroyed in the fire.

The county chief also dismissed reports that the fire might have been started by someone whose aim was to destroy important documents related to an ongoing investigation.

The fire lasted several hours as county firemen battled to extinguish it. Some residents of Kisii town also accused county officials of deliberately starting the fire, claims which have been dismissed by the county assembly leadership.

The power company’s clarification contradicts explanation by county leaders, who blamed the fire on an electric fault.

“Though it was interesting to find the transformer isolated, we are still investigating how exactly that happened. But by the time we got there, already there was no power and we did not attempt to restore it. We went ahead and isolated the power and the meter box,” said Mr Ogalo.

Property worth millions of shillings was destroyed. The fire broke out as ward reps were meeting the Ombudsman team at Ufanisi Hotel in Kisii.

Governor Ongwae had said the incident will be investigated by experts to establish the cause of the fire. 

The governor also commended the firefighters for their quick response.

“We thank God that no injury has been reported. No documents have been burned,” he said."
Ruth Mbula,"Protests have broken out in Kisii town ahead of Deputy President William Ruto’s visit today.

The protests have been staged by a pro-handshake team, but the DP’s supporters have come out to counter.

Dr Ruto is Thursday expected to visit Kisii County as the Gusii vote continues to attract the interest of politicians eyeing the country’s top seat in the 2022 General Election.

The visit comes two days after the DP hosted another consultative meeting with a section of elected leaders from the region, at his Karen residence in Nairobi on Monday. The DP will be hosted by his point men in the region -Kisii Deputy Governor Joash Maangi and South Mugirango Member of Parliament Silvanus Osoro. The two led the Kisii delegation that met the DP on Monday.

This was the fourth time DP Ruto was hosting a delegation from Gusii this year alone. He has also visited the region twice. Sources said the DP has scheduled another meeting with Gusii leaders later next month.

As the DP intensifies his presidential campaigns, supporters of his boss, President Uhuru Kenyatta, are also fighting for control of the region. There has also been growing interest around Interior Cabinet Secretary Dr Fred Matiang’i amid a push to have him run for the presidency in 2022.

On Thursday, the DP is expected to meet boda boda riders in Kisii town before moving to South Mugirango constituency for a meeting with women groups.

During the Monday meeting, DP Ruto hosted some current and former Members of the Kisii County Assembly (MCAs), youth leaders and bloggers. Mr Maangi told Nation that Monday’s meeting was part of a plan by the DP to win the support of the over 1.5 million voters in Gusiiland, which is made up of Kisii and Nyamira counties.

“The meeting at the DP’s official Karen residence was for ground mobilisers—MCAs- and the DP plans to camp in the region,” said Mr Maangi.

“The MCAs have often accompanied MPs in previous meetings and complained of being overshadowed. This was meant to give them an audience.""

In January this year, a delegation from Gusii visited Dr Ruto’s home in an apparent effort to pledge their loyalty. The delegation included politicians, professionals and grassroots leaders. Sources indicated that the quick move by Dr Ruto was aimed at expanding his support base after ODM leader and his political nemesis, Raila Odinga, and Interior CS Fred Matiang’i led a powerful group to assert BBI’s mission in Gusii.

Mr Maangi, who is Dr Ruto’s point man in Gusii region, MPs Joash Nyamoko (North Mugirango), Shadrack Mose (Kitutu Masaba), Vincent Kemosi (West Mugirango), Mr Osoro (South
Mugirango), Alpha Miruka (Bomachoge Chache) and nominated senator Millicent Omanga (Nairobi) attended the meeting.

In July, Kisii ODM chairman Samwel Omwando was in a group that paid the DP a courtesy call in his Karen residence and declared that they would campaign for him in the 2022 presidential election.

The DP met about 60 opinion and political leaders from Kisii county. The delegation, organised by Mr Osoro, was described as ‘inter-parties meeting’ and it led to the formation of the grouping ‘DP’s Foot Soldiers’. In August, Dr Ruto hosted another delegation of 10 civic leaders from Nyamira County at his Karen residence, a week after meeting another team from Kisii County.

As the DP held his meeting, another group of 25 MCAs allied to Dr Matiang’i, who is President Kenyatta’s point man in Gusii, congregated in a parallel gathering in Nakuru.

Each group claimed to represent the government and that their mission was to discuss development on behalf of their people.

Those at Ruto’s Karen meeting included Mr Mose, Mr Nyamoko and Mr Kemosi. There were also about 10 MCAs."
Ruth Mbula,"It has been two years since university student Sharon Otieno was brutally murdered and her body dumped in a thicket in Oyugis, Homa Bay County, but her killers are yet to be brought to book.

Sharon had been missing for a while when her body was found on September 4, 2018.

As her family marked the anniversary of her death on Friday, it said it remained distraught and that the last two weeks were difficult as memories of events surrounding the student’s death flooded.

The sluggish pace of her murder case is more disturbing, they said.

The main suspect in the murder case is Migori Governor Okoth Obado, who was her boyfriend and the father of their unborn child. On Friday, Sharon’s relatives attended a short prayer service at their home in Magara village, Homa Bay.

“It is like [she died] yesterday. The pain is still fresh in our minds,” said Mr Douglas Otieno, a peasant farmer. His wife Melida Auma is a mitumba trader and kindergarten teacher.

Mr Otieno said the case stalled after the coronavirus was first reported in the country in March.

“We have not heard anything concerning it. We were to go for a pre-trial hearing but nothing has been communicated to us,” he said.

They pleaded with the courts to fast-track the hearings so that the matter is put to rest.

“We pray for quick justice because that is the only thing which will somehow relieve the pain and anguish of losing our first born child,” said Mr Otieno.

The family made a comparison with political petitions, saying they are handled much faster as the families of murdered people live with the extreme pain that death brings.

“We are seeing other cases going on. Where is our daughter’s case? All we want is justice for Sharon and her baby,” said Ms Auma. Sharon, who attended Rongo University, was stabbed eight times while seven months pregnant.

Sharon and journalist Barack Oduor went missing last year in September. They were kidnapped but the journalists managed to jump out of the abductors’ moving car, sustaining serious injuries.

A postmortem report stated that the fatal blow to both Sharon and her unborn baby was a stabbing through the 26 year-old’s abdomen. 

Mr Obado admitted that the slain university student was his girlfriend.

Detectives and government scientists confirmed, to the highest degree known to science, that the baby boy ripped from Ms Sharon’s womb was Obado’s.

“There are 99.99+pc more chances that Zacharia Okoth Obado is the biological father of the foetus, that is Sharon Belyne Otieno’s child,” the detectives said.

The High Court in Nairobi released the governor on a Sh5 million bail.

His co-accused who are his close confidants, Michael Oyamo and Caspal Obiero, are awaiting conclusion of their cases."
Ruth Mbula,"Property worth millions of shillings went up in smoke in a fire that razed down the Kisii County Assembly chambers on Friday afternoon.

The cause of fire was not immediately established.

Governor James Ongwae and Speaker David Kombo said authorities will conduct investigation into the incident.

The fire broke out when ward reps were having a meeting with the Ombudsman team at Ufanisi Hotel in Kisii.

“The whole assembly chambers is burnt. I do not know who or what caused it. I am informed by those who were here that electricity was not there since morning and when it came, that is when the fire might have started,” said Mr Kombo.

The county assembly building houses the Kisii County government offices. Firefighters from the devolved unit helped save property after managing to put out the fire.

There was panic as staff scattered for safety.

Mr Kombo said they had lost millions of shillings’ worth of property and called on relevant authorities to carry out forensic enquiry on what caused the fire.

“We do not have an assembly now. This is the wrong term when we have Covid-19, a time we need to discuss how to help our people curb coronavirus spread,” said Mr Kombo.

“We will have to get expert advice on what happened,”  the governor said as he commended the firefighting team for quick response.

He said he had ordered the area cordoned for investigations purposes.

“We thank God that no injury has been reported. No documents have been burned,” said the county chief as he dispelled rumours that someone may have started the fire to destroy some documents crucial for investigation. "
Ruth Mbula,"Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i has read the riot act to national government administrators who allow the sale of illicit brew as well as drugs and substance abuse in their jurisdiction.

Dr Matiang’i said the use of alcoholic and narcotic substances has contributed to the rise of defilement, rape, murder and other forms of crime in the society.

He warned that each administrator right from the county commissioner to the chiefs and their assistants will be held personally responsible for any illicit brews and defilement cases reported in their jurisdiction.

“Performance for county commissioners, chiefs and their assistants will be gauged on how thy tackle illicit brews and alcohol abuse in their jurisdiction. Their Key Performance Indicators(KPI) will largely depend on how they handle this societal issues,” said the CS. He spoke yesterday at Kebirigo High School after meeting chiefs and their assistants in Nyamira County.

Before the meeting with the chiefs, he met elected leaders at the county headquarters among them Governor John Nyagarama, Senator Okong’o Omogeni and Woman Rep Jerusha Momanyi. 

He later met MCAs at the county assembly before leaving for a burial in Tombe. 

President Uhuru Kenyatta addressed the chiefs on phone telling them to focus on their work. The CS said cases of defilement,  domestic violence and consumption of illicit brews and drugs had increased during the Covid-19 period.

He particularly took issue with his Nyamira backyard where he accused national government administrators of laxity in curbing the vices.

Ruth Mbula,"Nairobi businessman Kevin Omwenga was buried Saturday, a week after he was shot dead in his house at Galana Suites in Kilimani, a case which is still under investigation.

The 28-year-old was buried at the family home at Soko Village, in Kitutu Chache South, Kisii County, a ceremony attended by flamboyant politicians and businessmen.

Steve Mbogo, Zaheer Jhanda, Don Bosco, Charles Nyagoto and several other ward representatives from Kisii and Nairobi were among the guests.

The politicians said Omwenga was a hardworking person whose death is regrettable.

Mr Nyagoto (Bogeka, Kisii) said they were keenly following the investigation and that they expected “nothing but justice”. Omwenga’s friends and relatives also called for justice.

His brother Wycliffe noted they are orphans and that their mother and sister died within the last one year.

“Let justice be done for my brother. I raised Kevin after the death of our father. The one who shot you knows why he did so. God will deal with him in his best way,” he said.

“The family needs prayers. Kevin died on the same date our mother did a year ago,” he said, adding they were planning a memorial. Robert Ouko Bodo and Chris Phillip Obure, the two suspects in Omwenga's shooting, will stay in police custody for 12 days as detectives complete investigations.

The ruling was made on August 25 after police requested more time to look into the matter.

Investigators will compile evidence, record witness statements, examine the firearm used in the killing and review surveillance footage.

They will also decide whether there is evidence to sustain any criminal charges against the suspects.

According to court documents, preliminary investigations show Mr Ouko shot the victim after having dinner with him and some friends and relatives.

Police will also look into the suspects' crime records and study the post-mortem report detailing circumstances that led to the car dealer's death on the night of August 21. "
Ruth Mbula,"Migori Governor Okoth Obado and his four children accused of stealing millions from public coffers yesterday had a long day that ended in them sleeping on cold, hard floors of police cells.

The Obados spent the night at the basement cells of Integrity Centre, the nerve centre of the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) in Nairobi, upon completing a 315-kilometre ride from Kisii to the capital.

Attempts by their lawyers to have them freed, citing closure of courts hit a brick wall as detectives insisted they remain in custody awaiting arraignment today.

Beset with pending criminal cases, including the alleged murder of his girlfriend Sharon Otieno, and possession of firearms illegally, Mr Obado is clearly a man under siege.

The day started by the county boss and his children — Susan Scarlet, Jerry Zachary, Evelyn Adhiambo and Dan Achola Okoth — surrendering to anti-corruption officers in Kisii to preclude their impending arrests. They were interrogated for three hours and when they emerged they put on brave faces before they were bundled into waiting vans for their journey to the capital.

The Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) Noordin Haji on Tuesday ordered their arrest to face corruption and larceny charges after EACC untangled and exposed what it said was a web of corruption.

“All is okay,” Mr Obado told journalists who were locked out of the EACC compound where he was being questioned.

The alleged involvement of Mr Obado’s children in the suspected criminal syndicate of larceny represents what has been dogging a number of counties countrywide whereby some governors use close family members and cronies to siphon funds meant for development.

EACC has been investigating Mr Obado following reports that he stole public funds through companies registered by his relatives. According to the DPP, the governor indirectly received Sh73.4 million from companies that traded with the county government during his first term in office.

Sources at the EACC offices said 10 out of the 11 suspects who surrendered for questioning were arrested and moved to Nairobi under heavy police escort.

In his arrest order, Mr Haji said Obado’s four children separately received Sh34.5 million from companies directly associated with Mr Obado and three brothers — Jared Peter Kwaga, Patroba Ochanda and Joram Opala — who acted as proxies in some firms the county boss owned.

“Public money was lost through connivance of the governor and the business entities in payments made for performance of contracts,” Mr Haji said in a statement on Tuesday.

The companies are Misoft Ltd, Tarchdog Printers, Deltrack ICT Services, Seletrack Consultants, Mactebac Contractors, Joyush Business, Swyfcon Engineering, Atinus Services, Kajulu Business, Victorious Investments, Dolphus Softwares, Dankey Press and Pesulus Services.

The EACC audit trail shows that the companies wired Sh38.9 million to three of the governor’s children, which was used to pay their school fees, upkeep, maintenance and medical bills in Australia, Scotland and the United Kingdom.

“Some of the money was used to buy two Toyota Land Cruiser V8s,” said Mr Haji. The investigation shows that Sh34.5 million was used to buy a house in Loresho, Nairobi, whose beneficial owner is Evelyn Adhiambo Zachary.

In a separate case under investigation, Mr Obado is accused of using proxies, including his relatives, to siphon Sh2 billion from the county coffers, according to an affidavit filed in court by the anti-corruption watchdog.

In a period of three years, the newly registered companies had transacted Sh1,971,179,180 in deals exclusively from the county government, which was glaringly disproportionate to their known legitimate sources of income.

“The commission received credible information that a few persons well known to be proxies of the governor, registered several companies for the purpose of fraudulent acquisition of public funds through fictitious contracts,” the EACC said two years ago. In November 2018, EACC sleuths raided the office and homes of the governor and confiscated, among other things, eight firearms, several bank statements and electronics.

Five of the firearms were found in Nairobi, while three were confiscated in Migori.

The detectives pounced at dawn, and spent hours rummaging through documents that could help in their investigations.

The governor was later charged in court and released on bail after Kibera Chief Magistrate Joyce Gandani dismissed an application to detain him pending conclusion of a firearms possession investigation.

The Kibera court freed the governor on a Sh500,000 bond with surety of a similar amount or Sh200, 000 cash bail and ordered him not to interfere with investigations."

After surrendering, the governor and his family were transferred to Nairobi after being grilled by EACC detectives for three hours.

Mr Obado and almost his entire family face charges related to theft of more than Sh70 million.

The Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) Noordin Haji on Tuesday ordered his arrest and his children for corruption and larceny charges.

“All is okay,” Mr Obado told journalists who were locked out of the EACC compound where he was being grilled.

The governor’s sons and daughters, who are also named as collaborators in the stealing of the Migori County funds also put on brave faces as they were escorted by uniformed and plain clothes police officers into waiting vans, which took them to Nairobi.

The governor’s children investigated by EACC are Susan Scarlet, Jerry Zachary, Evelyn Adhiambo and Dan Achola Okoth.

In a statement yesterday, EACC chief executive Twalib Mbarak said Mr Obado and his family will be brought to court by today to be charged with conspiracy to commit an offence of corruption and conflict of interest.

Ruth Mbula,"Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha now says powerful forces, including cartels in his ministry, are behind the pressure to reopen schools before the Covid-19 curve flattens.

Prof Magoha said Tuesday that there is a narrative being propagated by a section of the population whose aim is to get monetary gain.

“Businesses associated with opening of schools, some small number of private schools, some cartels in my own ministry are behind the narrative that schools must open,” the CS said in Kisii when he made an inspection tour at Kisii National National Polytechnic to assess its level of preparedness.

He spoke after a Nairobi parent sued the State over closure of schools, arguing that the measure is draconian and a violation of learners’ rights.

The CS said the government is not going to be intimidated though officials are happy to see that the Covid-19 curve is appearing to flatten.

“The government is alive and awake and it shall come back to the new roadmap. We are consulting all the necessary stakeholders,” he said.

Earlier in Migori, the Education CS hinted at tertiary institutions reopening in September with other schools reopening before January should there be a continuous drop in Covid-19 cases.

The CS while on an assessment tour at Rongo University on Tuesday disclosed that a joint committee of stakeholders was monitoring the preparedness of schools and reopening will be pegged on the outcome of the report.

“We are conducting a daily monitoring of the situations at our learning institutions and once we are convinced that the Covid curve is flattened we will act promptly,” Prof Magoha said.

The CS, however, maintained that the government’s earlier position of re-opening schools in January 2021 still stands.

“I want to be categorical that we are inching closer to flattening the curve and based the daily updates on the declining numbers, our position of opening schools in January can be altered any moment,” he said.

He added: “Should the curve flatten at any time, nothing stops us from re-looking at the time table and adjusting our position, why should we keep our children at home if situation stabilises?” he posed. "
Ruth Mbula,"A Kisii County resident has filed a petition at the High Court seeking orders to compel Safaricom to disclose the total amount of money raised by Coalition for Reforms and Democracy (Cord) leaders to pay striking teachers in 2015.

The funds were subscribed and contributed to M-Pesa pay bill number 672672, dubbed the “Teachers Solidarity Account”.

Wiper Democratic Movement leader Kalonzo Musyoka, his Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) party counterpart Raila Odinga and Safaricom Limited are listed as respondents in the petition filed by Mr Thomson Osoro and the Rigena Human Rights Watchdog Organisation.

On September 23, 2015, the two Cord principals launched a funds drive to mobilise resources for striking teachers.

“I am apprehensive that the three respondents were in a scheme through collusion, falsification and forgery to defraud Kenyans for their selfish gains at the expense of the then striking teachers without justification by dealing with specific entities to swindle unsuspecting members of the public,” reads the petition.

The petitioner argues that Safaricom has failed to disclose the amount of money raised by members of the public through the M-Pesa pay bill number 672676.

""Further, the two principals have failed to account for the money raised seven years later,"" said Mr Osoro, a human rights activists.

He says he has filed the petition as a member of public who is among Kenyan citizens who felt duped by the two leaders. He claims that Safaricom, being the largest telecommunications provider in the country, has failed to protect its clients from offensive financial integrity as envisaged under the leadership and integrity of Act of 2012.

The petitioner now wants the court to issue an order that if the funds contributed by the public have already been withdrawn by Mr Odinga and Mr Kalonzo, then they should be compelled to deposit all the funds raised to the Covid-19 kitty.

“We need the money to help buy beds and ventilators in counties to manage Covid-19 patients,” said Mr Osoro.

The petition is also seeking to have the court compel the two former Cord principals and Safaricom to cater for the cost of the petition jointly.

“This is in addition to any such orders that the court may deem fit or expedient,” the petition reads.

The case is set for mention before Justice Anthony Ndungu at the Kisii High Court on September 22 this year.

During a rally at Uhuru Park, Mr Odinga announced that he and his co-principal Kalonzo Musyoka had each deposited Sh100,000 into the M-Pesa account.

The petitioners also want to know if the contributed money was used for the intended purpose, that is, to paying striking teachers.

“This would have enabled them to go back to class but it was indeed a contravention on the 2010 
Constitution since the two principals had no mandate to pay teachers, which is the mandate of the Teachers Service Commission” said Mr Osoro.

He alleges that to date, there are no records showing how the money was used as promised to members of the public.

“Kalonzo and Odinga indeed received the public contributions through the said salary kitty to pay the then striking teachers knowingly,” Mr Osoro told the court.

“Since the two Cord principals were in a campaign mood, they deceived Kenyans of goodwill that they were better placed to assist the then striking teachers which was not the case at all,” alleges Mr Osoro. "
Ruth Mbula,"Farmers at the Keyian Cooperative Society in Trans Mara West are counting losses estimated at over Sh20 million after a fire razed down their sugarcane plantation.

The arson attack, which happened on Wednesday night, came barely a month after the group incurred a Sh50 million loss after unknown people burnt down another section of the sugarcane farm.

This was the third incident happening at the group’s ranch after a similar arson attack in May 2016.

“Our group ranch members are very disappointed that this is the third time in less than five years we have incurred losses totalling to over Sh80 million through arson attacks over what we consider as an economic sabotage by unknown people,” said the group’s chairman Phillip Saiyuah.

The group’s executive secretary Dickson Kisaka said that they have employed hundreds of employees in their sugarcane and tea plantations and also in their dairy and beef cattle farms and do not understand the motive of the attack.

Mr Kisaka called on the government to carry out investigations to reveal the people behind the arson attack on the ranch which sits along the border of Narok and Kisii counties.

The operations manager of the ranch Saitoti Mutaka said the remaining sugarcane will be harvested immediately in order to prevent further losses.

 “Various economic activities that generate revenue for both the national and county governments happen at our ranch and it is unfair that some people would want to destroy the project that is beneficial to many people,” said Mr Mutaka.

Trans Mara West Deputy County Commissioner Mohammed Noor said that security officers have opened investigations to establish who wis behind the arson attacks. He added that security has been beefed up at the ranch.

“Keyian Farmers’ Cooperative Society has a General Service Unit Officers camp within its vicinity with the government having increased security surveillance to ensure we do not have similar occurrences in future,” said Mr Noor. "
Ruth Mbula,"Julius Kormoto ole Maki is a household name in Trans Mara West Sub-County.

Here, Mr Maki is revered as a peace ambassador, having spent the past two decades uniting warring communities in the broader Narok County.

For his invaluable efforts, he has been recognised by two Heads of State.

In 2012, the 70-year-old Maki was awarded the Head of State Commendation (HSC) by former President Mwai Kibaki.

In October 2019, the retired senior chief was feted by President Uhuru Kenyatta during Mashujaa Day celebrations in Mombasa.

He was, particularly, honoured for contributing to peaceful co-existence of different ethnic groups in Narok County. Julius Kormoto ole Maki is a household name in Trans Mara West Sub-County.

Here, Mr Maki is revered as a peace ambassador, having spent the past two decades uniting warring communities in the broader Narok County.

For his invaluable efforts, he has been recognised by two Heads of State.

In 2012, the 70-year-old Maki was awarded the Head of State Commendation (HSC) by former President Mwai Kibaki.

In October 2019, the retired senior chief was feted by President Uhuru Kenyatta during Mashujaa Day celebrations in Mombasa.

He was, particularly, honoured for contributing to peaceful co-existence of different ethnic groups in Narok County. His peace mission began in 2002, after his retirement from President Daniel Moi’s government.

“I became a chief in 1982 after serving as a primary school teacher for about a decade,” said Mr Maki, whose first appointment was as chief of Uasin Gishu East location, now known as Shankoe Location.

He was promoted to the position of senior chief in 1994, after he successfully stopped bloody ethnic fighting between his Maasai community and the neighbouring Kisii over cattle rustling and land.

He recalls an incident in 1997 when a chief inspector of police serving in the General Service Unit was killed near Nyamesocho along the common border.

He said the Kisii and the Maasai had fought all night long and the GSU was called in. The Kisii fighters, he claimed, brought in their dreaded Chinkororo and within no time, two GSU officers were killed, one of them a chief inspector.

The killing of the security officers prompted then Nyanza provincial commissioner, the late Wilson Chepkwony, and his Rift Valley counterpart Yusuf Haji, to convene a crisis meeting at the border, where they asked the Kisii to surrender the guns they had taken from the slain officers.

Speaking to the Nation at his Trans Mara home, Mr Maki said one year after retiring as senior chief, members of his Maasai community were embroiled in bitter inter-clan clashes that claimed many lives.

“The Moitanik, Siria and Uasin Gishu clans fought a lot over land. Police for a long time tried to stop them but were unsuccessful and some of them were killed in the skirmishes,” recalled Mr Maki.

It was then that he joined two other two chiefs from Siria and Moitanik clans and brought together a group of elders, locally known as ‘traditional chiefs’. “These elders can curse and bless and they are highly feared,” said Mr Maki.

“When one of the morans dropped dead just after arriving on the battlefield against our advice, the rest immediately put down their arrows and spears.”

Mr Francis Olesinoni (Siria) and Mr Joseph Tasur (Moitanik) teamed up with ole Maki to end the year-long war in 2003 and are among those who were feted by President Kibaki.

“In 2016, we helped end a two-year-long war at Pimbinyiet between the Maasai and Kipsigis communities,” said Mr Maki.

“We appealed to the local communities to surrender the firearms that were being used to propagate the fight along the Kilgoris-Emurua Dikirr border. About 100 firearms and nearly 300 rounds of ammunition were surrendered to the government by locals. Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i received them,” he said.

“That was one of my greatest achievements,” Mr Maki said.

“We saved our people from the usually crude forcible disarmament.” He says the National Land Commission (NLC) promised to sort out land issues in the border region but four years on, that is yet to happen.

“Government officers should stop taking people for a ride and keep their promises.”

On the recent Nkararo border war, Mr Maki says there is a silver lining as communities have agreed to lay down their arms.

He has also been instrumental in stopping skirmishes between Kuria, Kisii and Maasai communities.

“I am yet to physically receive the second award,” he revealed.

“But my name was among those President Kenyatta listed in his Mashujaa Day speech.” "
Ruth Mbula,"Police in Kisii County are searching for their colleague Eunice Achieng Okal, who was last seen on July 30.

Constable Achieng, who was based at Nyanchwa Police Station, asked for a day off on July 29, saying she wanted to visit her sick grandmother in Migori County.

Preliminary investigations say she did not visit the grandmother but met her ex-husband John Owuor Odiango in Kisii.

But Mr Odiango was found dead at his home in Oyugis, Homa Bay County, on August 7, in a case of a suspected suicide. Kisii County Police Commander Jebel Munene said the police officer was supposed to return to work on July 31.

“We instigated disciplinary action against her on that day after she failed to return to work,” Mr Munene said, adding the process was cancelled after her relatives reported that she had been missing since August 4.

“On August 6, the ex-husband’s relatives and those of the missing officer separately reported the persons missing at Nyanchwa Police Station,” the police boss said, adding that the man left Bomet, where he worked, for Kisii on July 29.

Reports indicate that Ms Achieng and her former husband met in Kisii to finalise a deal in which she was to get Sh250,000 from him, from a business they co-owned.

As Mr Odiango’s relatives were making a report on their missing kin at Nyanchwa, one of them received a phone call and was informed that he had been spotted in Oyugis and that he appeared to be of unsound mind.

“They searched for him until midnight but could not get him. His naked body was found hanging from the roof the following day. His clothes were found dumped at his neighbour’s compound,” a police source said, adding his ex-wife’s shawl was used in the hanging. Mr Munene said that before Mr Odiango’s body was found, police had traced his phone signal to Kilgoris.

“On August 6, our officers, in conjunction with those from Nakuraro Police Station in Kilgoris, combed the area and searched through sugarcane plantations but found nothing,” he said.

The police officer’s phone signal was last traced to Rongo.

Sources revealed that M-Pesa transactions were made using Ms Achieng’s phone before it went off.

Further, it is believed the two were using a car to move around and that it may have had other occupants."
Ruth Mbula,"Despite spending almost Sh1 billion on Covid-19, most counties in South Nyanza cannot reveal the contractors, even as claims of corruption and misappropriation of funds erupt in the region.

An investigation by the Nation has established that Migori, Kisii and Nyamira counties have set aside about Sh1 billion to fight Covid-19.

Kisii has a total budget of Sh356 million. From this, Sh156 million is a grant received from the national government and the remainder was set aside from its budget.

On its part, Nyamira County received Sh59 million from the national government and set aside Sh110 million from its budget.

Migori received Sh60 million from the national government and set aside Sh40 million from its internal resources. The county assembly later allocated it an additional Sh296 million to fight the pandemic.

Kisii and Migori counties could not verify contractors behind the projects, information that should otherwise be readily available to the public.

As of last week, the number of Covid-19 positive cases was more than 340 in the three counties. This includes 300 in Migori alone, 34 in Kisii, and eight in Nyamira.

Nyamira County currently has about 120 isolation beds, which is far below the 300 target ordered by President Uhuru Kenyatta.

At Nyamira Referral Hospital, a Sh9.5 million Covid-19 isolation centre was launched by Governor John Nyagarama about a month ago.

The 17-bed unit was initially an old-dilapidated amenity wing at the county’s main hospital, which was renovated to be used for Covid-19 cases.

The contractor who was awarded the project is Haemonetics EA Ltd. Its directors are Vincent Orangi Ogega, Rhoda Nyasani Mabiria and Peter Sagwe Mandere. Bombagi Dispensary is also an isolation centre and has five beds.

The Covid-19 facility, which is 85 per cent complete, will have 160 isolation beds.

The contractor, Seaman Building and Civil Engineers Ltd, is on site.

“We realised that it would take a long time to start construction of a new building. We just decided to complete the four-storey building which was still under construction,” said Health Executive Douglas Bosire.

Mr Bosire said that the county had factored Sh142 million for its construction in the previous budget.

He said they gave the project additional funding of Sh35 million from the Covid-19 Emergency Fund which is Sh110 million in total.

Sources from the county government have linked Mr Bosire with the project, claiming the directors of Seaman Building and Civil Engineers Ltd are his in-laws, claims that he has denied.

Our search at the company registry found that Scolastica Wangu Macharia, Margaret Muthoni Macharia and Francis Macharia Mbugua are the directors of the company.

“The directors are not related to me in any way, they are not my in-laws and won the tender competitively. These claims have been there since devolution began,” said Mr Bosire.

Mr Bosire said the county leadership further converted the old operating theatre at the Nyamira Referral Hospital into a five-bed ICU.

Gianche Investments Ltd was awarded the construction project. The directors of this company are listed as Kennedy Ondicho Maranga and Charles Momanyi.

Out of the Sh59 million received from the national government, the county will use the money to equip the isolation centres and help in the construction of a new building.

Already, Sh33 million has been set aside for its construction. The new building, he said, will have a capacity of 160 beds.

At sub county hospitals, preparations to set up more isolation beds are in progress. Kioge Health Facility will have 25 beds, Igena Itambe (60) and Nyakegogi (20).

The health executive further revealed that they are getting other supplies like linen and patients’ uniforms from Kemsa and Rivatex.

“Other local manufacturers have also been supplying us with these items,” he said.

The Nation has, however, established that most of the local manufacturers have no registered companies and it would therefore be tricky for the county government when it comes to accountability.

Mc-Finelly is one of the companies that has been supplying the county with hospital beds.

The county did not disclose how many and how much has been used to buy the beds.

In Kisii, out of the Sh156 million that was availed by the national government for the fight against Covid-19, the county has spent Sh60 million to purchase various items from Kemsa — including ICU ventilators, PPEs, medical equipment, ICU beds, bedside lockers and mattresses.

The county said Sh40million has been spent on renovating and equipping the ward and setting up 10 ICU beds for Covid-19 patients.

Another Sh20 million went into renovation of outlying facilities, purchasing 600 sets of linen and 300 beds, drug trolleys, patient trolleys, lockers and drip stands, among other equipment. The remaining Sh36 million has been set aside for any eventualities.

Kisii is among counties that will only tell you how much they spent, but not who got the contract.

There are no reasons why accounting officials refuse to share recipients of tenders for spending public money.

We asked for verification of this specific information and the procurement companies involved, but officials refused to disclose.

“Top elected leaders in the county use proxies to register the companies. Companies associated with them are awarded major projects, other contractors are locked out,” said a contractor.

We established that Ms Mercy Makena Chweya through her company, Sanitary Napkins Distributors Kenya Limited, was awarded a contract to carry out fumigation in Kisii County. It is not clear how much the company was allocated.

Governor James Ongwae, in one of his functions, thanked Ms Chweya for repackaging for free 3,000 litres of sanitiser donated to Kisii County Government by Kibos Sugar Company Limited of Kisumu to help combat Covid-19.

Some residents however questioned the rationale behind the free packaging, saying it was a cover-up.

In Migori, the Nation established that while the county faces aggressive rate of coronavirus infections, there were only 150 beds in the county’s isolation centre at Macalder Hospital.

Efforts to establish the actual progress on the ground for Covid-19 preparedness were hampered by an obstructionist staff.

A source undertaking construction at the new ICU wing said Bingo Construction Limited was awarded the project. A search of the company revealed names of people who may be relatives.

"
Ruth Mbula,"Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe on Friday told the Abagusii that one of their sons had the potential of clinching the presidency if they supported and protected him from “external political forces”.

Using the parable of an expectant woman, Mr Kagwe said the people of Gusii should read the signs of the time and unite so that the rest of the country can in turn support their son to lead Kenya.

Mr Kagwe’s remarks at a leaders’ meeting held at the Kisii County Assembly grounds seemed to target his Cabinet colleague, Dr Fred Matiang’i, who is from the region and who has been touted as a potential presidential contender in 2022.

“If you see a protruding tummy of a woman and it continues to grow, what do you think is growing in there? Just use eyes to conclude that a child is about to be born,” said Mr Kagwe to ululations from the attendees. “If you do not nurture and protect the expectant mother, feed and protect her from external dangers, you would blame yourself if she loses the pregnancy.” 

“You, Abagusii, know that in politics, people fight and undercut one another. But this is not the time for political backstabbing. If you behave normally, the world will treat you normally,” Mr Kagwe added.

Dr Matiang’i, who attended the meeting, did not respond to Mr Kagwe’s remarks and steered off politics.

Although the two leaders rallied residents behind President Uhuru Kenyatta, it was clear that Dr Matiang’i is being fronted for the presidency in the next polls. Mr Kagwe and Dr Matiang’i are in the Nyanza region on a four-day tour to assess the impact of Covid-19 in Kisii, Homa Bay, Kisumu and Bomet counties and their preparedness.

The ministers were received by dozens of residents who lined the streets of Kisii town.

Later, the Health CS briefed the nation on the Covid-19 situation, reporting 727 new infections from a sample of 6,814 people.

Five of the new cases are from Kisii.  The cumulative cases in the country are 25,138.

Kisii Governor James Ongwae reiterated that the community has come of age and that the Interior CS will represent them when it comes to sharing the national cake.

Kisii Senator Prof Sam Ongeri, MPs Richard Onyonka (Kitutu Chache South), Jimmy Agweny (Kitutu Chache North) Richard Tong’i (Nyaribari Chache) and Woman Rep Janet Ong’era led their constituents in urging the CS to declare his interest in leading the country.

“We have our son here who has left a mark in all the ministries he has served. We are urging our people to rally behind him for the highest seat in the country,” said Prof Ongeri.

Apart from the political class, four Cabinet Secretaries have voiced their support for Dr Matiang’i. Prof George Magoha (Education), Joe Mucheru (ICT), Keriako Tobiko (Environment) and Eugene Wamalwa (Devolution) last year said their support for Dr Matiang’i was unwavering.

The Abagusii Council of Elders even anointed him and his colleagues and the Gusii leaders then.

In their prayers and in what was seen as a direct endorsement for the presidency, they likened the CS with the biblical David and asked him to keep fighting for the welfare of Kenyans.

Although the CS has not personally announced plans to run for any political seat, calls for him to vie the highest office in the country have been growing.

Council of Governors chairman and Kakamega governor Wycliffe Oparanya also attended the long-day event accompanied by Budalang’i MP Raphael Wanjala and Busia Woman Rep Florence Mutua.

Mr Kagwe said men continue to lead in the number of infections, with 539 male against 188 female patients. “Our behaviour pattern is not helping us,” said the CS, as he explained that men have been blatantly flouting Covid-19 guidelines. “Congratulations to our health workers. Even those in home care are still being observed by community health workers.”

Mr Kagwe and Dr Matiang’i lauded Governor Ongwae for preparing his county to handle Covid-19 cases.

“I am proud of what Kisii has done today. They have more than 300 isolation beds and we are here to ensure they get a testing centre,” he said.

CS Matiang’i warned owners of bars that continue to operate against the ban on the sale of alcohol, saying their licences will be revoked.

“The President issued a very clear directive. We will take the licences of bars that continue to risk the lives of Kenyans,” said the Interior CS. 

Mr Oparanya said the national government had released Sh 29.7 billion for counties.

“I thank the President for ensuring the release of this money,” said the Council of Governors chair. "
Ruth Mbula,"Kenya's cumulative number of coronavirus cases shot to 25,138 on Friday, with the recording of 727 more cases after the testing of 6,814 samples in 24 hours.

While on a tour of Kisii County to assess measures taken to fight the Covid-19 pandemic, Health Cabinet Secretary (CS) Mutahi also reported that 674 more patients had recovered, raising the total to 11,118.

Another 14 patients had died, he said, raising the death toll to 413.

Of the new patients, 711 were Kenyans and 16 foreigners, while  539 were male and 188 female.

While noting the continued recording of more cases of male patients, CS Kagwe asked them to be as careful as women had been.

As of August 7, Kenya, which confirmed its first Covid-19 case on March 13, had tested a total of 342,132 samples. CS Kagwe visited Kisii alongside government officials including Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i and Council of Governor chair Wycliffe Oparanya (Kakamega).

He lauded Kisii Governor James Ongwae on steps including establishment of five isolation facilities with 386 beds and the availability of 41 beds for patients needing intensive care.

The CS also noted that the Kenya Medical Training College in the county, which is being used as a quarantine facility, has 400 beds.

While noting the separation of facilities for patients with the virus and those with other ailments, the minister urged the public not to be afraid to go for treatment.

""Don't remain at home. You may end up succumbing to those other illnesses,"" he told the public.

CS Matiang'i attributed development in Kisii's health sector to its good working relationship with the national government.

""There is no acrimony among the county, MPs and the national government,"" he said, adding about 20,000 homes were being supported through special programmes by the government.

In his report on the county, Governor Ongwae said it had 300 beds at isolation centres and would be acquiring 100 more. He promised to pay health workers' salaries by next Tuesday. "
David Mwere,"A Parliamentary committee has now requested Auditor-General Nancy Gathungu to undertake a special audit into the expenditure of billions of shillings allocated to the national and county governments for the Covid-19 pandemic interventions. 

The Senate Ad Hoc committee on Covid-19 made the request amid claims that funds allocated to deal with the pandemic may have been diverted to other uses not related to the disease, misapplied or misappropriated. 

The committee chaired by nominated Senator Sylvia Kasanga also wants Controller of Budget (CoB) Dr Margaret Nyakang’o to furnish it with a special budget review implementation report on the utilisation of funds by the 47 devolved units towards the pandemic interventions. 

In two separate letters to Ms Gathungu and Dr Nyakang’o, Senate Clerk Jeremiah Nyegenye, on behalf of the committee, noted that the special audit should cover the period between March 13 and July 31, 2020. 

“The Committee therefore requests that you undertake the special audit and submit an independent report,” Mr Nyegenye says, adding that the report should be submitted by email on or before September 4, 2020. 

The report from the Controller of Budget is required by August 21. 

The first Covid-19 case in Kenya was reported on March 13, with the numbers surging to near the 24,000 mark as at yesterday. Fatalities are at 391 while the number of those who have recovered is nearing 10,000. 

The special audit as requested by the Senate comes as the Finance and National Planning Committee of the National Assembly prepares to summon top officials from the Ministry of Health over the expenditure of Covid-19 billions advanced by various development partners around the world.

Other senior officials from State agencies under the ministry are also lined up for grilling.

According to Mr Nyegenye, the audit should review and establish whether the counties had approved work plans, procurement, and training plans in place specific to the pandemic before the funds were disbursed. 

Ms Gathungu is also required to review and establish the total amount of money received by the counties, as well as the bank accounts into which the funds were banked."
David Mwere,"Lawmakers Wednesday approved lavish lifestyles for their predecessors who served between 1984 and 2001 when they approved changes to the pension law.

The passage of the 2019 Parliamentary Pension (Amendment) Bill means the government will be required to pay at least Sh1.15 billion in lumpsum enhanced pension to the former MPs.

The amount is backdated to July 1, 2010, when the Parliamentary Service Commission (PSC) adopted recommendations of the Akiwumi Tribunal, which reviewed the terms and conditions of MPs and employees of Parliament.

Only part of that report was implemented.

If President Uhuru Kenyatta signs the bill into law, the National Treasury will be required to set aside at least Sh144 million every financial year to cater for the monthly pension of the 150 lawmakers who served during the time.

Each will be taking home what they are currently getting plus a monthly pension of around Sh80,000 minus tax, calculated at the rate of 15 per cent.

The amount is a significant improvement from Sh2,000 to Sh5,000 for MPs who served before the 2010 Constitution.

Those who served between 1963 and 1984 were not entitled to a pension scheme as there was no such law at the time.

National Assembly Minority Leader John Mbadi, who sponsored the bill, said the proposed law does not benefit current lawmakers.

“We are passing this bill for elderly former MPs. I wanted the former MPs to get something to sustain themselves,” Mr Mbadi told the Nation yesterday.

The Akiwumi Tribunal was formed by the PSC in January 2009.

The tribunal extracted its findings from the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association and submitted its report on November 2, 2009.

One of its recommendations was that the 500 former MPs at the time be paid the equivalent of Sh100,000 as living pension from July 1, 2010.

The PSC adopted the report in June 2010 but also recommended an enhanced pension for the MPs who served between 1963 and 1983 so as to cater for all lawmakers.

However, the National Treasury opposed the bill on account that if signed into law, there would be pressure from former MPs earning higher pension to be considered for a similar increase.

“A former MP getting Sh101,415 would feel aggrieved that he or she served for a long time and is now getting the same amount as those who were in Parliament for one or two terms,” Treasury PS Julius Muia said in an October 30, 2019, letter to National Assembly clerk Michael Sialai.

“The same will apply to current MPs once they retire.”

Treasury is also worried that if signed into law, the bill will set a wrong precedent for other categories of public servants.

The Treasury wants an actuarial evaluation conducted to evaluate its opinion and that the report be referred to the Salaries and Remuneration Commission.

The law provides that an MP qualifies for pension if he or she has served for at least two terms and is above 45 years old.

Pension is a contributory scheme between the MP and the PSC and is governed by the Parliamentary Pensions Act.

"
David Mwere,"Government employees and front-line health workers continue to remain exposed during the Covid-19 pandemic period following the expiry of their medical, life and last-expense insurance covers.

The contracts for the scheme that caters for civil servants and the National Police Service expired on March 31, but the National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF) is yet to renew them.

This is despite a directive by President Uhuru Kenyatta on April 16 requiring that all essential and front-line personnel be taken care of in respect of, among other areas, insurance cover.

President Kenyatta said such an incentive would motivate doctors, nurses and other cadres of health workers tackling Covid-19.

So far, more than 670 front-line workers have been infected with the coronavirus.

Nevertheless, the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA) has directed NHIF to follow the procurement law to the letter in getting a new party to provide the covers. In an advisory letter to NHIF boss Peter Gathege, PPRA Quality and Research Manager Peter Ndung’u, on behalf of the director-general, notes that even if the tender for the provision of medical cover is advertised now, it would still leave the beneficiaries exposed until the award letter is issued.

“You are reminded to ensure that the subject procurement is carried out in accordance with the Act and the Regulations issued under the repealed Public Procurement and Disposal Act, 2005,” Mr Ndung’u says in the letter dated May 8, 2020.

Mr Gathege was unreachable for a comment by the time of going to press. “While we note that the urgency and the risk exposure presented by the expiry of the contract cover in particular due to Covid-19 disease and the need for provision of insurance cover to essential and front-line personnel as directed by the Head of state, we note that your procuring entity sought our advice one month after the subject contract expired,” Mr Ndung’u says.

The effect of the delayed recruitment of an insurance provider is that government doctors, nurses and other front-line health workers and civil servants who succumb to Covid-19 or any other critical illnesses will most likely not be compensated.

The practice is that NHIF contracts the provision of Group Life Cover and Last Expense Cover to a third party through tendering. According to PPRA, while Section 139 (2) of the Act guides on the extension on contract periods, the procurement law does not have a provision for extending expired contracts.

Section 44 (1) of the Act states that an accounting officer of a public entity shall be primarily responsible for ensuring that the public entity complies with the Act.

Initially, National Treasury Cabinet Secretary Ukur Yattani had barred NHIF from engaging in commercial insurance because it is not registered with the Insurance Regulatory Authority (IRA) as an insurance provider.

Section 19 of the Insurance Act provides that a firm providing insurance services in the country must be registered with IRA.

Mr Yattani’s decision saw then NHIF acting Chief Executive Officer  Nicodemus Odongo, in a letter dated February 26, 2020, announce that the cover for the government employees  would lapse on March 31, 2020m, meaning new providers would have to be found.

The implication of this letter was that the affected clientele will now be forced to tender for other providers.

The move followed months of haggling and correspondences between the National Treasury and the Ministry of Health over whether NHIF, a state corporation, should be allowed to engage in commercial insurance despite not being registered as an insurance provider under the Insurance Regulatory Authority (IRA).

The end of the medical insurance cover provided by NHIF through third parties also affected at least 52 institutions that were already on board.

They include state corporations, county governments and private entities including associations and church groups across the country.

However, on June 3, 2020, Mr Yattani exempted NHIF from the provisions of section 19, 179 (6), 197A and 197B of the Insurance Act for the purpose of offering enhanced medical, group life and last expense cover for the government employees.

But the NHIF is yet to get a new service provider on board. "
David Mwere,"A series of blunders by top Jubilee and Nasa leaders precipitated the paralysis that rocked the Senate’s sixth attempt at adopting a new formula for sharing county revenue on Tuesday night, the Nation can reveal.

The House failed to make progress, much less pass the third basis of sharing Sh316.5 billion allocated to the 47 counties, even after extending its sitting into the night.

A parliamentary group meeting that never was, hands-off leaders, lack of a united approach to the matter, a series of amendments, calls to defer the motion and grandstanding saw the Tuesday debate adjourned before the formula could be enacted.

But the day just started on the wrong footing, especially for the divided Jubilee house, after a planned parliamentary group meeting to whip senators to back the formula aborted. The meeting was to be chaired by President Kenyatta, who was expected to help whip Jubilee senators opposed to the new formula to toe the party line.

Minority Leader James Orengo (Siaya) did not have kind words for Mr Kenyatta as he accused him of being aloof at the time the House needed his guidance in the revenue impasse.

“We have lost our heads. We would not be here if the President was accessible. I’m not saying it for me, but for the country,” Mr Orengo said.

This failure saw Majority Chief Whip Irungu Kang’ata resort to calls and text messages to lobby lawmakers to adopt the report by the House Finance and Budget Committee on the Commission on Revenue Allocation (CRA) proposal. But even as this happened, senators wondered why Majority Leader Samuel Poghisio (West Pokot) would be allowed to leave the country to the neighbouring Tanzania for the burial of former President Benjamin Mkapa.

“The seriousness of this matter required Senator Poghisio to be here as the Leader of Majority,” a Jubilee Senator, who didn’t wish to go on record, said.

“His absence and the fact that the President knew where he was at a crucial time, shows that the government is not committed to having this formula enacted. There are other government functionaries who should have travelled,” he added.

But as fate would have it, Mr Poghisio did not land in Tanzania as his plane was forced to turn back in unclear diplomatic circumstances and had the opportunity to be in the House late in the night. “By the time he was coming back, a lot of water had gone under the bridge,” the senator further said.

The Finance Committee, chaired by Kirinyaga Senator Charles Kibiru, had its own weaknesses that largely contributed to the delayed enactment of the formula.

On three occasions, Mr Kibiru had failed to move the motion on the report as he made himself unavailable. Every time he was required to move the motion, he was nowhere to be seen — perhaps on instructions from some powerful forces, causing the House to adjourn.

Its own members — including Makueni Senator Mutula Kilonzo Junior — disagreed with the committee’s recommendations and proposed their own version of the formula, further complicating the matter.

As per the original CRA proposal, 28 counties are to gain while 19 are to lose out on the allocations, some losing billions of shillings. The committee, upon considering the CRA proposal, reworked some of the parameters, whose adoption would have seen 29 counties benefit as 18 others lose.

However, a majority of senators, whose counties were either gaining or losing, led by Mr Kilonzo Junior, ganged up to oppose the committee report.

Senators Cleophas Malala (Kakamega), Sam Ongeri (Kisii), Johnson Sakaja (Nairobi), Anwar Oloititip (Lamu), Philip Mpaayei (Kajiado), Boniface Kabaka (Machakos) and Kipchumba Murkomen (Elgeyo Marakwet) opposed the committee’s report despite their counties gaining as per the CRA formula.

They supported the Kilonzo amendment, which, if adopted, would have ensured no counties lose out on their equitable shares. “We were requested by the majority and minority leaders to look for a middle ground. We do not want to see some counties losing while others are gaining because that is not the spirit of devolution,” Mr Kilonzo said Wednesday.

“All counties must win because they serve the people of Kenya. If you analyse our proposal, no county is losing,” he added.

Ordinarily, by virtue of their leadership positions in the House, deputy leader of majority Fatuma Dullo (Isiolo) and deputy majority whip Farhiya Haji (nominated) were required to support the committee’s report. However, they ganged up to support Mr Kilonzo’s proposal.

Yesterday, the Makueni senator said that the government’s failure to give counties more funds as demanded by the Senate in the last two financial years was to blame for the stalemate.

“The third basis formula was predicated on shareable revenue of Sh345 billion or more. The minute we allowed the temptation to apply new data, new parameters on a figure that has remained constant for two years, we knowingly entered into a dark and slippery path to divisive and cantankerous debate,” he told the Nation. The push for one method and not any other, he noted, created clear divisions that were characterised by the voting on Tuesday.

Suspicion and mistrust, he added, contributed to the emotional debates.

Jubilee’s Isaac Mwaura (nominated) termed the government side as disorganised. “It wasn’t clear to many what the defeat of the amendment meant,” he said.

“Some 2022 politics came to play and some people chose to play national, while others chose to defend their counties. In the end, we had to adjourn to get more consensus,” Mr Mwaura told the Nation.

As the clock ticks away, the enactment of the formula continues to remain divisive and elusive.

While senators, largely from the Mount Kenya region, are pushing for the one man, one vote, one shilling mantra, to influence the allocation, their colleagues from the sparsely populated counties want land mass to be the definitive parameter in revenue allocation.

“In sharing the devolved funds among the counties, population should be the main indicator,” Mr Kang’ata said. Narok senator Ledama Olekina said that such hard-line positions as pushed by Mr Kang’ata will not help in resolving the stalemate.

“We want leaders to reason together for the sake of devolution because that is our core mandate as senators,” he said.

The CRA developed the formula as required by the Constitution and submitted it to the Senate on April 30, 2019.

This was to give the Senate enough time to consider the proposal, which is a radical shift from the first and second, as it expanded the parameters for the shareable revenue among the counties.

On Tuesday, House business became congested as Senators Kang’ata and Dr Ali Ibrahim (Wajir) among others also came up with their own proposals, eating into the time allotted for the Senate to transact its business for the day. Not even a procedural motion to have the Senate sit until the matter before it is concluded could save the day as debate extended to 9pm — forcing Deputy Speaker Margaret Kamar to adjourn the sitting until August 4 at 2pm, in compliance with the 9pm to 5am curfew hours.

Initially, when he sensed that the matter was becoming divisive, Mr Orengo and Mr Moses Wetang’ula (Bungoma) tried to have a debate on the formula deferred.

But their proposal was resoundingly shot down as 40 senators against seven voted to oppose.

Yesterday, Mr Orengo noted that the authority and integrity of the Senate was better protected and safeguarded “if we did not rush to a decision when there’s an opportunity to close loopholes where there’s no general agreement,” the senator added.

However, Mr Kang’ata defended his opposition to deferring the matter to another sitting as proposed by Mr Orengo, noting that it was akin to postponing a problem, which “is not helpful to the country.” According to the Standing Orders, the senators were required to finish all the preliminaries on the motion on the adoption of the Finance Committee report first before embarking on the substantive motion.

As time went by, the House was yet to deal with the proposal by Mr Kang’ata to have the implementation of the finance committee report deferred for two years.

A majority of the senators favoured the proposal by Mr Kilonzo that reworks the CRA formula so that no county loses money, which would later be moved by Mr Sakaja.

However, when the matter was put to the vote, 25 of the Senators voted to oppose the deferment as they rallied behind Kilonzo Junior’s proposal."
David Mwere,"The National Assembly faces an uphill task of raising a supermajority to overturn President Uhuru Kenyatta’s memorandum that rejected an enhancement of former MPs’ monthly pension following the recommendations of its committee.

At least two-thirds majority or 233 of the 349 MPs in the National Assembly are required to veto the President's memorandum, a feat that is yet to be achieved by the House since the promulgation of the 2010 Constitution.

Mr Kenyatta rejected to sign into law the Parliamentary Pensions (Amendment) Bill, 2019, which sought to increase the minimum monthly pension for lawmakers who served between July 1, 1984, and January 1, 2001.

The Finance and National Planning Committee in its report to the House after considering the memorandum wants it shot down in the looming showdown.

The Bill, sponsored by the leader of the minority in the National Assembly John Mbadi (Suba South) and approved by the MPs in August, would have seen the more than 375 former lawmakers' monthly pension rise to above Sh100,000 from the current Sh33,000.

President Kenyatta, however, declined to sign the Bill into law, arguing that it would add an unwarranted Sh444 million annual tax burden on taxpayers. In the memorandum, the President also argued that the Bill overlooks the mandate of the Salaries and Remuneration Commission (SRC), which includes setting and reviewing of remuneration and benefits for all State officers among them the MPs.

The SRC had petitioned President Kenyatta to reject the Bill terming it illegal because MPs didn’t seek its input on the planned changes.

But in a bid to flex its muscle, the committee dismissed the President’s reasoning noting that inflation and high cost of living make it impossible for the former MPs to survive on the pensions they are earning.

“The committee having considered the President’s reservations on the Bill recommends that the House agrees with its decision to reject the President’s memorandum,” its report reads. "
David Mwere,"Gifted with the ability to hop from one scandal to another, the National Land Commission (NLC) does not disappoint when it comes to shoddy multibillion-shilling deals. In another shocking report, Auditor-General Nancy Gathungu has exposed a chaotic body that doesn’t follow the rule of law when handling public funds. 

Sanctioned by the National Assembly’s Committee on Public Accounts (PAC), the special audit details high-level impunity, ranging from expenditures without approvals by the National Treasury to glaring irregularities. 

Covering land compensation between 2014-17, the report has disturbing details for taxpayers. The commission received Sh23.11 billion from other State agencies for compulsory acquisition of land for public projects, but the expenditure has left more questions than answers.

A huge chunk of the money went into the flawed compensation for land along the Sh327 billion Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) line corridor and Ms Gathungu has now prodded the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) and the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) to take action against the NLC. Before acquiring land on behalf of other entities, funds would be transferred to the NLC account at the National Bank of Kenya. Other than the Kenya Railway Corporation (KRC), the other institutions were Kenya National Highways Authority (KeNHA), the Kenya Urban Roads Authority (KURA), the State Department of Housing and Urban Development and National Water Conservation and Pipeline Corporation (NW&PC).

Lamu Port South Sudan Ethiopia Transport (Lapsset) corridor project and the Tanathi Water Services Board also had transactions with NLC. While the acquisition of the parcels was necessary, NLC allegedly abused public finance laws.

These include failure to maintain a database or register of all public land acquired and failure to conduct searches at the registry. The queries could drag former chairman Muhammad Swazuri back into the spotlight.  Ms Gathungu notes that, of the Sh23.11 billion, Sh14.29 billion transactions were marred with irregularities. 

As a result, the government could lose up to Sh9.57 billion because of the NLC’s failure to conduct searches at the registry to confirm that the parcels acquired were not public land. The absence of fairness and accountability in the process saw the NLC commit Sh7.74 billion.

The commission heavily relied on valuation compensation schedules that were either not dated, or not signed. In some cases, payments were made without evidence of valuation reports. In such circumstances, it was impossible to validate instances of over compensation, double compensation in different areas or false claims of compensation.

The report indicates that Sh2.12 billion was transferred to the commission for the acquisition of land along the Lapsset corridor and Sh3.58 billion for land in Thwake Dam by the Tanathi Water Services Board.

Kura had Sh867.63 million transferred for the Nairobi Eastern link road and Sh715.36 million for the Meru Eastern and Western bypasses. KeNHA sent NLC Sh224.20 million for the Kangema-Gacharage (C 70) road in Murang’a.

The State Department of Housing and Urban Development had Sh135.47 million set aside for the Murang’a sanitary landfill project while NWC&PC had Sh94.32 million sent to NLC for Muruny ‘Siyoyi’ water project.

The commission is also in hot water for spending Sh226.25 million without the evidence of approval by the National Treasury, which is contrary to the Public Finance Management (PFM) Act.  Section 68 (1) of the PFM Act requires accounting officers to ensure public resources are used in a lawful and authorised manner. The funds in question were proceeds of monthly interest earned on deposits by NLC for the operational expenditures.

The audit notes that Sh92.16 million and Sh134.08 million was earned in interest during the 2015/16 and 2016/17 financial years, respectively. “These funds had not been budgeted for and there was no approval given by the National Treasury or Parliament for the funds to be utilised for this purpose,” the report notes.

The failure by the commission to adequately respond to audit queries on time, which is against the PFM Act, also cast doubts on the expenditure of Sh3.40 billion. In another strange deal, the government may lose up to Sh221.38 million for payments made to affected persons along the Embakasi Station railway reserve, whose titles had been “revoked by the NLC committee on review of grants and dispositions”. This means that it was public land and that the government may have ended up acquiring its own land. The beneficiaries are Dasahe Investments Ltd (Sh89.93 million) for 0.904 hectares, LR No 9088, Sh43.82 million for 0.44 hectares, LR No 9087 and Sh43.82 million for 0.44 hectares, LR No 9085. Olomotit Estate Ltd got Sh43.82 million for 0.44 hectares, LR No 9086. 

Interestingly, all the payments were effected through Keboiwo Investment Ltd, which had not been listed as the owner of the acquired parcels. The audit report was unable to establish the circumstances under which NLC effected payments to a company that was different from the one that had been listed.

Kenya Railways Corporation (KRC), the acquiring entity of the SGR line land, risks losing Sh21.79 million over the questionable acquisition of 12.98 hectares in Sultan Hamud. The land was compulsorily acquired for the construction of an SGR station.

But the KRC would later redesign the SGR route, resulting in the relocation of the station to Emali, without giving an explanation. This means that the Sultan Hamud land remains idle despite government funds having been used.

Although the Land Act requires the NLC to maintain a register of all land acquired, Ms Gathungu established that the commission does not have one.

The law states that the register should be geo-referenced and authenticated by the statutory body responsible for survey, in this case the Survey of Kenya (SoK)."
David Mwere,"A parliamentary committee has indicted some State corporations for engaging in irregular procurement, contrary to the law.

The Public Investments Committee (PIC) notes in its 23rd report on the consideration of the Auditor-General’s reports on financial statements of State corporations that, the Public Procurement and Asset Disposal Act, its regulations and government circulars were misused, leading to inflated project costs.

The report of the committee chaired by Mvita MP Abdulswamad Sharif says that, some contracts were poorly managed, leading to delays in completion and in the escalation of costs.

Kenya National Highways Authority (KeNHA) and Kenya Airports Authority (KAA) are among the parastatals that violated the law leading to loss of public funds.

For instance, KeNHA had Sh341.2 million awarded to M/s Telewa Road Construction Limited for the maintenance of the Mombasa-Miritini road in the 2014/15 financial year. However, the contract was terminated due to poor performance after having paid the contractor Sh144.2 million, which is 42.25 per cent of the contract sum.

KeNHA then went ahead to repackage the contract and award it to M/s SS Mehta through direct procurement at Sh292.7 million. This was in contravention of the procurement law. The variation brought the total contract expenditure to Sh436.8 million, an increase of Sh95.6 million over the original contract.

“This was in breach of the law and resulted in wasteful expenditure,” the committee’s report, currently under debate in the House, reads. To forestall the wasteful expenditure of public resources, the House team wants chief executive officers of State firms to ensure proper project planning with credible feasibility studies done to reduce cost variations during execution.

Further, PIC wants CEOs who exceed the maximum contract variation of 25 per cent provided for under the procurement law, to be surcharged.  A number of projects KAA executed were similarly challenged. "
David Mwere,"The planned nationalisation of Kenya Airways (KQ) appeared to run into turbulence even before it could take off after National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi directed a reconsideration of the process.

This comes after the report of the Transport, Public Works and Housing Committee on the National Civil Aviation Bill 2020, was challenged by MPs in the House for failing the requisite public participation, forcing Speaker Muturi to intervene.

Mr Muturi told MPs that he did not want to see the House acting in vain especially if the committee’s report that was questioned by MPs Tom Kajwang’ (Ruaraka), Aden Duale (Garissa Township), Bashir Abdullahi (Mandera North) and Kimani Ichung’wah (Kikuyu) among others, is successfully challenged in court.

“I direct that the committee sets aside three days to take views from the public so that everybody feels satisfied,” Speaker Muturi ruled.

The Speaker further directed the clerk’s office to agree with the committee chaired by Pokot South MP David Pkosing when an advertisement for the public participation should be placed in the media. “It is only fair that we avoid a situation where it could be said that we were acting in vain,” the Speaker said while reminding the House that the route the Bill was taking is similar to the Merchant Shipping Line Act.

The Act was annulled by a three-judge High Court bench on the basis that there was no sufficient public participation. The appeal is pending in the Court of Appeal.

The government is pushing for the passage of the Bill to nationalise the national carrier by merging it with the Kenya Airport Authority (KAA), the industry regulator.

The merger, according to a Cabinet paper, shall then lead to acquisition and latter privatisation to return KQ to profitability.

The Bill, therefore, gives effect to the committee’s report in the House on June 17, 2019 and adopted by the House.

The report recommended the nationalisation of the debt-ridden national carrier after an inquiry into Kenya Airways Privately Initiated Investment Proposal (PIIP) to KAA. The national carrier is grappling with over Sh220 billion debt and needs a government bailout to compete favourably with foreign airlines flying into the country, according to a confidential report tabled in the Cabinet.

However, Mr Kajwang alerted the House over the manner in which the committee had done its report immediately Mr Pkosing tabled it to pave the way for the debate on the Bill.

According to Mr Kajwang’, quite a number of stakeholders including the Law Society of Kenya (LSK), private law firms and the Competition Authority of Kenya (CAK), were blocked from appearing before the committee.

Wajir North MP Ahmed Ibrahim, member of the committee noted that he was among the five committee members who dissented on the report. "
David Mwere,"Ann Nderitu inched closer to being appointed as the country’s first substantive Registrar of Political Parties (RPP) under the 2010 Constitution after President Uhuru Kenyatta nominated her for vetting by the National Assembly.

In his notice sent to the National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi Tuesday, President Kenyatta also nominated for consideration by the House three assistant registrars of political parties.  They include Mr Ali Abdullahi Surraw, Ms Florence Tabu Birya and Mr Makore Wilson Mohochi.

“The committee is advised to expeditiously proceed to notify the nominees and the public, commence the approval hearings in good time and table its report before September 24, 2020 to enable the House consider the matter within the statutory timelines,” Speaker Muturi said of the Justice and Legal Affairs Committee (JLAC) that will vet the nominees. 

In appointing the assistant registrars, the Political Parties Act requires that not more than two individuals shall be persons from the same gender in the spirit of the two-thirds gender rule.

If approved by the House and formally appointed by the President, Ms Nderitu and her three assistants will serve for a non-renewable term of six years and will not be eligible for re-appointment.

Since the Office of the Registrar of Political Parties was formed in 2007, it has never had a substantive holder.

Initially, the registrar of societies, then a department at the Attorney-General’s office, was in charge of registration of political parties after the advent of multiparty politics in 1991.

Ms Lucy Ndung’u served as the acting registrar from 2007 to 2018, when she was appointed a commissioner with the Commission on Administrative Justice (CAJ) also known as Ombudsman.

She was succeeded by Ms Nderitu, the former Head of Electoral Training at the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC).

According to the Sixth schedule of the Political Parties Act, the National Assembly has 21 days of receipt of the names to consider the suitability of the nominees and either approve or reject them.

According to the Public Appointments (Parliamentary Approval) Act, if the National Assembly fails to approve or reject the nominees within the 21-day timelines, the nominees shall stand approved for appointment by the President.

The submission of the names for vetting comes after President Kenyatta was put on the spot for delaying the process of appointing the registrars.

Public Service Commission (PSC) chairman Stephen Kirogo had previously told Nation that the commission had indeed forwarded the list to the president of the individuals deemed to have passed the interview in July.

He however, could not tell why the submission of the names to the National Assembly for vetting had been delayed. 

“We did everything we could as required by the law and submitted the names of the individuals to the appointing authority for action. The list also included how the interviewees performed,” Mr Kirogo told Nation on phone.

The interviews for the shortlisted candidates were held between June 29 and July 2, 2020, at the city’s PSC offices.

In transmitting the nominees to the House for vetting, the Political Parties Act requires the President to choose one nominee from the list of three sent to him for Registrar’s position and three others from the list of nine individuals nominated for assistant registrars’ positions. 

The 6th schedule of the Act further provides that the President shall, within 14 days of receipt of the names of the nominees as submitted by PSC, forward them to the National Assembly for approval hearings otherwise known as vetting.

However, by mid-August when the National Assembly was proceeding on a long recess, it had not been notified of the nominees.

According to the law if the National Assembly approves the nominees, the Clerk of the National Assembly shall, within three days of the approval, forward the name of the approved persons to the President for the formal appointment in the Kenya gazette.

In the event that the National Assembly rejects a nominee, the Clerk of the National Assembly shall, within three days of the rejection, communicate the decision to the President.

The president shall then be required to submit a fresh nomination from among the persons nominated.

The whole process will be forced to start afresh if the House rejects a subsequent nomination.

Ms Nderitu was among 10 individuals shortlisted for interviews from 88 applicants following the close of the advertisement period on June 2, 2020.

The three assistant registrars emerged from the list of 37 individuals interviewed by PSC out of the 618 applications it received.

David Mwere,"Availability of cheap credit to the micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) looks far from becoming a reality as the government continues to exceed its domestic borrowing target, according to a recent document by the Parliamentary Budget Office (PBO).

The details contained in the PBO’s half-year economic and fiscal update as at August, shows that by June 30, the net domestic borrowing by the government amounted to Sh367.4 billion against a target of Sh233.4 billion.

“By the end of June, the government surpassed its domestic borrowing target, possibly taking advantage of the increased liquidity by the commercial banks,” the PBO report notes. The report, which is intended to keep the MPs updated on the latest trends in the economy for necessary interventions, could be distressing particularly to the MSMEs, more so during the Covid-19 pandemic. Considering the fact that towards the end of last year, parliament amended the Public Finance Management (National Government) Regulations to increase the country’s debt ceiling from 50 per cent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to an absolute numerical figure of Sh9 trillion. The push by the National Treasury for the amendment was to free up the local borrowing space to the MSMEs as the government goes for the relatively cheap concessional loans from the external market.

“Given increased caution in lending by commercial banks and the increased borrowing by the government, the private sector credit will be negatively affected hampering private sector growth,” PBO warns

Economist Tony Watima notes that increased domestic borrowing is the biggest fiscal problem the country continues to grapple with despite assurances from the National Treasury.

He says the recently released Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) performance shows that the country missed revenue target by more than Sh100 billion. This is an indication that the government will continue to borrow from the local market to plug the ever expanding budget deficit.

“The National Treasury always goes for local borrowing because it is the easy way out compared to foreign borrowing. It shows that fiscal consolidation that the government keeps talking about never takes effect. If it happened we should have scaled down government spending to meet revenue expectations,” Mr Watima notes.

He adds that increasing the debt ceiling from 50 per cent of the GDP to a figure of Sh9 trillion made sense.

“The model of moving from percentage figure of the GDP to an absolute figure made sense. Treasury has been playing around with the percentage. Treasury mandarins have been saying that the country’s debt to GDP was around 50 per cent when it was nearing the 60 per cent mark by the time former CS Henry Rotich left Treasury,” Mr Watima says.

"
David Mwere,"The architecture of the 2008 Constitution of Kenya Review (CKR) Act helped by the PNU-ODM coalition government after the bloody 2007 election heralded the final antidote for new governance laws.

The country ushered in a new Constitutional moment on August 27, 2010 after long, tedious and divisive processes that led to arrests and deaths.

The Act safeguarded constitution-making from political and judicial exigencies that had marked previous processes.

The constitutional review roadmap was enacted with the 2007 post-election violence still in the minds of Kenyans.

It served to overcome barricades put on the road for a process that began in 1990 through the repeal of section 2A to allow multiparty politics. Ahead of August 2010, the country had had sufficient experiences for a new constitutional order – the Inter-Parties Parliamentary Group (IPPG) reform package of 1997, the 2002 Bomas Draft, the 2002 and 2007 General Elections and the 2005 referendum.

The agitators of the new constitution wanted governance strengthened by providing proper checks and balances as opposed to institutionalising individuals. They also wanted resources devolved to the grassroots.

The Act was a self-propelling mechanism with strict timelines. With the Act in place, the Committee of Experts (CoE) – a mechanism that would safeguard the review from undue political interference – was formed.

The team, chaired by Mr Nzamba Kitonga, revised the original harmonised draft constitution taking into consideration submissions by Kenyans.

It was basically a continuation of the process started by the Constitution of Kenya Review Commission (CKRC) in 1999. In coming up with a new constitution, the committee used three primary documents.

There was the CKRC that came up with a report after collecting views from across Kenya in 2002.

The report was later referred to as the Ghai Draft, named after Yash Pal Ghai who chaired the CKRC. It is what was discussed at the Bomas of Kenya Constitution Review Conference.

It gave birth to the Bomas Draft, which would later be subjected to scrutiny to yield the Wako Draft, named after Attorney-General Amos Wako, now Busia senator.

The Wako Draft is what was rejected in the 2005 referendum.

In doing its work, the Kitonga team that had nine executive and two ex-officio members, used the Ghai, Bomas and Wako drafts to come up with the Harmonised Draft on January 8, 2010. The CoE consisted of local and foreign experts. Other than Mr Kitonga, the committee had Ms Atsango Chesoni (vice chairperson), Mr Bobby Mkangi, Mr Otiende Amollo, Mr Abdirashid Abdullahi, Ms Njoki Ndung’u and Mr Wako.

The foreign component had Dr Chaloka Beyani (Zambia), Prof Christina Murray and Prof Fredrick Ssepembwa (Uganda).

Dr Ekuru Aukot was the committee director. Mr Wako and Dr Aukot did not participate in decision-making as they were ex-officio members of the committee.

The CoE came up with several propositions, including a parliamentary system of governance, a powerful senate and devolution.

However, this was not the end as the report was submitted to the Parliamentary Select Committee, chaired by the then Mandera Central MP Abdikadir Mohamed.

According to Mr Mkangi, the difficult work of coming up with a constitution had been done.

“Ours was to synthesise the documents that had the voices of Kenyans,” Mkangi said.

“We had to consider the views of wananchi and remain true to that. To some extent, politicians played negative roles but that was part of the process.”

Ms Chesoni said what made the team’s work easier was an understanding that its mandate was not to impose decisions on Kenyans but to harmonise the information “we already had”.

“We were tasked with coming up with a document that encompassed the views of Kenyans. That is what we did,” she said.

Ms Chesoni and Mr Mkangi said the CoE identified four areas that were contentious in coming up with a harmonised document. They were governance, devolution, people representation and transitional issues.

Though devolution had been agreed on, the problem lay in the architecture – whether to adopt a three or two tier system and what relationship between the government and the other units would be. There was push and pull on whether to adopt a parliamentary, presidential or hybrid system of governance.

There was also lockdown on having a bicameral system, if Judges who served under the old constitution should go home as well as when the new parliament should come in – immediately after the promulgation of the constitution or after the next election.

“The CoE wanted a system that was democratic, had the principle of separation of powers, the rule of law, national values among others,” Ms Chesoni said.

Mr Mkangi added that Kadhis Courts and abortion would also arouse debate.

However, the CoE unity and the architecture of the legal roadmap were the real deal to the constitution.

“We had a very short timeline and one of the first resolutions was that we would not ask for an extended period,” Mr Mkangi said.

“We only voted once and it was on a procedural matter.On the contentious issues, we debated with sobriety and arrived at decisions fast.”

The committee would later recommend a parliamentary system of governance, bicameral parliament, two-tier devolution among others.

At this point, the PSC came in.

The makeup of the committee was unique because it allowed Mr Mohamed, a backbencher to chair it so as to avoid the risk of having an individual with presidential or other ambitions higher up the political ladder, to lead it.

Mr Mohamed defeated Eldoret North MP William Ruto, now Deputy President, for the seat.

“That was the unwritten rule. To have someone not from the major tribes competing for power in the country to chair the special committee,” Mr Barasa Nyukuri, a governance expert, said.

The special committee had the face of Kenya.

Other than government ministers, assistant ministers and the Deputy Prime Ministers Uhuru Kenyatta and Musalia Mudavadi, it had the disabled, the marginalised and others.

Mr Mohamed said ODM pushed for a strong senate but PNU never wanted a senate.

ODM also wanted a parliamentary system but PNU preferred a presidential system of governance

“To balance the opposing extremes, PSC we settled on a weak Senate and a hybrid system of government so as not to cause division by portraying one side of the coalition government to be winning,” Mr Mohamed said."
David Mwere,"The National Assembly’s Public Accounts Committee (PAC) has ordered a forensic audit on the Sh134 billion allocated for the fight against Covid-19 amid public uproar over misuse of the funds.

In a directive to the Auditor-General Nancy Gathugu, the public watchdog committee wants the audit to cover the expenditure period between March 13 when the first case was reported in the country and July 31.

“We will work professionally as provided for in the law to ensure that we get to the bottom of the matter so that Kenyans can know how the money was used,” said PAC chairman Opiyo Wandayi after a meeting of the committee at Parliament building.

The PAC directive comes in the wake of suspected Covid-19 related procurement fraud at the Kenya Medical Supplies Authority (Kemsa), which buys drugs for all public health facilities in the country.

The authority’s CEO Jonah Manjari has since been suspended alongside directors Eliud Muriithi (Commercial) and Charles Jume (Procurement) to allow for the investigations into claims of procuring Covid-19 emergency kits at exorbitant prices.

According to the National Assembly Standing Orders, Ms Gathungu will have 60 days to present a comprehensive audit report to the committee for action.

The PAC set the audit scope on the procurement, warehousing and distribution of essential medicines including Personal Protective Equipment (PPE’s) and requires the office to verify whether the expenditures were incurred lawfully and in an effective way.

PAC also wants a review of the fiscal measures undertaken by the government to mitigate against the spread of the pandemic, including a Sh13 billion stimulus package passed in the last financial year.

The Sh13 billion includes a Sh10 billion cash transfer programme to the urban vulnerable and the poor and Sh1 billion to recruit health workers to strengthen the human capital capacity of the Ministry of Health.

The amount also comprises Sh400 million for food and non-food commodities for affected households and Sh1.5 billion for purchase of testing kits and reagents.

In the current financial year, the government set aside Sh53.7 billion for Covid-19 response.

The national government has also received significant assistance from both bilateral and multilateral partners to support the fight against the pandemic.

The World Bank gave Sh6.8 billion under the Contingency Emergency Response to the Ministry of Health for prompt preparations and response towards procurement, warehousing and distribution of essential medicines including PPEs.

The government also received Sh78.3 billion under the Rapid Credit Facility of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to address the impact of the pandemic and Sh108 billion from the World Bank under the second Development Policy Operation as both budgetary support and extra resources to help fight the pandemic. 

There is also a concessional loan of Sh22.5 billion advanced to the country from the African Development Bank (ADB) to support the government measures against pandemic and additional Sh7.5 billion commitments from the European Union inform of grants.

The government also established a private Covid-19 Emergency Response Fund to receive voluntary contributions from well-wishers towards defraying expenses associated with the disease.

The general objective of the forensic audit is to identify the types of fraud, corruption and other financial improprieties if any.

The Auditor-General is further required to quantify the amount of loss, who was involved, when it began, why it was possible to perpetrate it and how it was concealed.

The specific objectives is to determine whether the funds allocated for Covid-19 interventions have been used for the purposes intended while establishing if appropriate controls are in place to prevent or detect other irregularities.

The committee expects to receive an interim report within the first 30 days of the assignment and, thereafter, fortnight progress reports and final report by the end of the task.

David Mwere,"An MP wants the National Assembly to compel the Treasury to have an estimated Sh5 trillion of illicit cash stashed in foreign accounts repatriated to the country.

In a request for statement filed in the House, nominated MP Godfrey Osotsi wants Attorney- General Kihara Kariuki to give an undertaking when the government will honour previous promises to have the money injected back into the economy.

“The Attorney-General should provide the latest update on undisclosed funds in foreign bank accounts including in Switzerland, Japan and the United Kingdom and the details of the accounts held as well as the interest earned,” said Mr Osotsi.

The nominated MP also wants the Attorney-General to provide the details of individuals operating the suspicious accounts.

“Kenya needs this money to meet its monetary and fiscal challenges, clear the ever-growing public debt, finance infrastructure projects and stabilise the economy. The fight against corruption should give more focus on recovery of money and property,” said Mr Osotsi.

If recovered, the money will be enough to finance the country’s annual budget for two years comfortably without taxation and local and foreign borrowing to supplement the budget.

In the current financial year, the government has budgeted to spend Sh2.79 trillion, which is less by about Sh200 billion what was spent in the 2019/20 financial year. The recovery will also boost the country’s commitments to settle public debt, estimated to be more than Sh6.2 trillion, thereby saving Kenyans from the current punitive taxation regime.

Mr Osotsi’s push comes after a recent survey by a reputable American think-tank National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), reported that powerful individuals hold more than Sh5 trillion of illicit money in undisclosed foreign accounts.

Economist Tony Watima noted that despite relevant laws in place, including Mutual Legal Assistance Act and Proceeds of Crime and Money Laundering Act, the government remains helpless in having the monies returned to build critical infrastructure.

“The country has proclaimed its tigritude in the war against corruption and illicit capital flight for too long now. It is the time to pounce and seize the dragon,” said Mr Watima, noting, “We can be dealing with the same thing day in, day out with no tangible results to complement the efforts.”

According to Mr Watima, the existing legal framework forms the basis for identification, tracing, freezing, seizure, confiscation and repatriation of such proceeds.

Mr Osotsi’s desire is based on the fact that under the Public Finance Management Act, the National Treasury is required to publicise and aggregate its sources of revenue to fund the national budget brought to the National Assembly."
David Mwere,"President Uhuru Kenyatta is on the spot for delaying the appointment of a substantive registrar of political parties (RPP) after he failed to submit to the National Assembly a nominee for the position as required by the law.

This comes after Public Service Commission (PSC) Chairman Stephen Kirogo confirmed that the commission had forwarded the list to the President.

“We did everything as required by the law and submitted the names of the individuals to the appointing authority for action. The list also included how the interviewees performed,” Mr Kirogo told the Nation by phone.

The interviews were held between June 29 and July 2.

The Political Parties Act requires the President to choose one nominee from a list of three for registrar’s position and three others from a list of nine nominated for assistant registrar.
The sixth schedule of the Act further provides that the President shall, within seven days of receipt of the names of the nominees, forward them to the National Assembly for vetting.

However, by the time the National Assembly was proceeding on recess last week, it had not been notified of the nominees, meaning that the president has violated the Act by ensuring that there is a substantive RPP.

According to the law, the National Assembly is required to within 14 days, consider the nominees and approve or reject them.

If the National Assembly approves the nominees, the Clerk of the National Assembly shall, within three days of the approval, forward the name of the approved persons to the President for gazettement.

David Mwere,"In just three days, two top Amani National Congress (ANC) officials have walked away, putting the party in the spotlight as it pushes its leader Musalia Mudavadi to gun for the country’s presidency in 2022.

The exit of secretary-general Barrack Muluka and his replacement Eliud Owalo has laid bare the split in the party.

While some want Mr Mudavadi to go for the top seat, others insist that he should become Deputy President William Ruto’s running mate.

Mr Mudavadi said he has grown tired of being told “that we are working for William Ruto”.

“We welcome Dr Ruto as long as he supports our bid for the presidency,” he said on Thursday, adding that there are no differences between him and President Uhuru Kenyatta.

Mr Muluka and Mr Owalo have been accused of pushing Mr Mudavadi towards the Ruto camp.

His confidants sought to change the ANC constitution to stop the party leader from becoming anyone’s running mate in the coming elections.

The changes are meant to make the party leader an automatic presidential candidate.

When he quit as ANC secretary-general on Wednesday, Mr Muluka said the space around Mr Mudavadi “needs to be decongested”.

Mr Owalo, who had been appointed by Mr Mudavadi as Mr Muluka’s replacement, resigned yesterday, giving a similar reason: –“to create ample space in the party and ANC leader without feeling suffocated with my views and suggestions”.

Analysts say the two men had grown weary of waiting for a “handshake” between Mr Mudavadi and Dr Ruto.

In early June, the DP held talks with some ANC and Ford Kenya leaders in which they agreed to work on a political pact.

The meeting came four days after Mumias East MP Benjamin Washiali hosted 32 ward representatives dubbed “soldiers of Ruto”, from four counties in Western Kenya.

Mr Washiali told the group to be “friends with Mr Mudavadi because he is in talks with the DP for a possible deal ahead of 2022”.

Sources told the Saturday Nation that the quitting of the two was due to “the Ruto effect”.

A source said Mr Mudavadi, Dr Ruto and Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang’ula had agreed to work together in a deal that would see them go into the 2022 elections as a team.

It is after the verbal agreement that Mr Mudavadi publicly declared, at a rally in Lugari, Kakamega County, that he had no problem working with the DP and gave conditions for their engagement.

One of the agreements was that Dr Ruto must make a public undertaking to support Mr Mudavadi’s presidential bid. The source said Mr Muluka and Mr Owalo were the brains behind the deal.

“They were the ideological force that was to craft the agreement on the ANC side,” the source added.

“Just look at the general body of their resignation letters. They were definitely written from one source and by the same person.”

Mr Muluka was discreet in his relations with Dr Ruto, preferring to work behind the scenes for fear of a backlash from Western Kenyan leaders.

Mr Owalo has been this visible latecomer to the ANC vessel. He was always seen in the company of Mr Mudavadi.

Recently, he was spotted at Dr Ruto’s Karen home in what many thought was a dress rehearsal for Mr Mudavadi’s arrival.

Within ANC circles, Mr Owalo, the party’s unsuccessful candidate in the November 2019 Kibra by-election, was quietly known as the linkman to the Deputy President.

He has the support of lawmakers favouring the agreement between the two leaders.

The MPs are Mr Titus Khamala (Lurambi), Ms Beatrice Adagala  (Vihiga Woman Representative), Mr Omboko Milemba (Emuhaya) and former Kakamega senator Boni Khalwale

“Mr Muluka and Mr Owalo are not happy with Mr Mudavadi for not honouring the deal with the DP,” the ANC source added.  However, ANC deputy leader Ayub Savula branded Mr Owalo traitor.

“Mr Owalo was a mole who came to the party to drive Ruto’s agenda,” Mr Savula said.

“To scuttle Owalo’s plans, we amended the party constitution so that Mudavadi does not become anyone’s deputy. Once he realised he could not achieve his mission, Owalo had no option but to take a walk.”

Mr Owalo declined to comment on the claims.

“I want to create reasonable legroom with Mr Mudavadi to guard and sustain our 25-year friendship, respect and professional engagements,” Mr Owalo, a management consultant, said.

The “mole” allegations are partly based on Mr Owalo’s late entry to the party.

He joined ANC just days to the November 2019 Kibra mini-poll.

The poll was called following the death of incumbent MP Ken Okoth.

Mr Owalo had pulled out of the Orange Democratic Movement primaries. Dr Ruto’s camp has denied any links with Mr Owalo.

Belgut MP Nelson Koech accused Mr Savula of stretching his imagination too far.

“Mr Mudavadi is a national and respectable leader and the DP would not hesitate to reach out to him. The DP is pragmatic and does not work through emissaries,” Mr Koech said.

Mr Savula and his Sabatia counterpart Alfred Agoi, however, described Mr Muluka as a selfless leader.
Mr Agoi said the changes would give Mr Mudavadi an opportunity to make ANC have a national outlook.

“Muluka is a good person to work with. He gave everything to the party. We cannot begin saying he did nothing. The former ANC secretary-general will continue rendering professional services to the party,” the Sabatia MP added.

“It should also be noted that an opportunity has presented itself to Mudavadi to project himself as a national leader. He should ensure ANC has the face of the country, especially in its leadership. Mudavadi needs to reach out to leaders outside Western Kenya ahead of the General Election.”

Contacted yesterday, Mr Muluka – who became ANC secretary general in October 2017 – said he has travelled his political journey and that he does not see himself joining another party.

“I have done my tour of duty and will continue to render my support to the party leader whenever called upon to do so,” Mr Muluka said.

“The party should now populate itself with freshness. It needs oxygen. I see many young people ready to step into my shoes whenever I look around.”

"
David Mwere,"The National Assembly is headed for a collision with the Senate after it declined to approve 12 bills for further debate in what could rekindle the bitter supremacy wars between the two Houses.

Kieni MP Kanini Kega, who chairs the Budget and Appropriations Committee (BAC) of the National Assembly, told the House last week that the committee could not approve the 12 bills based on the advice of the Parliamentary Budget Office (PBO) as they are ‘money bills’.

“These bills did not originate as required. The committee, therefore, recommends that they should not proceed,” Mr Kega told the House.

The budget office advises Parliament and its committees on fiscal matters.

The bills were passed by the Senate and sent to the National Assembly for concurrence as required by the constitution but BAC flagged them on account that their purported passage is unconstitutional.

“The other House should stand guided on their powers and mandate. They should remain on their lane because they are overstepping their mandate. If a senator has a bill that has a money aspect, they can identify a member in this House to sponsor it,” the Kieni MP said.  The bills, whose fate now looks sealed include County Boundaries Bill (2017), Office of the County Printer Bill (2018), Food Security Bill (2017), Disaster Risk Management Bill (2018), Public Participation Bill (2018)and the Treaty Making and Ratification (Amendment) Bill (2018).

The others are Prevention of Terrorism (Amendment) Bill (2018), Personal Data Protection Bill (2018), County Oversight and Accountability Bill (2018), Local Content Bill (2018), Natural Resources (Benefit Sharing) Bill(2018) and Commission of Administrative Justice (Amendment) Bill (2019).

According to Mr Kega, the bills are “money bills” and that it is only the National Assembly that can originate them in line with Article 109 (5) of the constitution.

The Article provides that a bill may be introduced by any member or committee of the relevant House of Parliament, but ""a money bill"" may be introduced only in the National Assembly.

Article 114 (3) of the constitution goes on to define “a money bill” as one that contains provisions dealing with taxes, imposition of charges on a public fund or the variation or repeal of any of those charges.

A money bill also deals with the appropriation, receipt, custody, investment or issues of public money as well as the raising or guaranteeing of any loan or its repayment and any other incidental matters.

However, the Senate has the power to only originate the County Allocation of Revenue Bill, which is “a money bill” as provided for in Article 218 of the constitution. The county revenue bill divides among the 47 counties the revenue allocated to them equitably from the national government.

Article 110 (3) of the constitution provides that before either House considers a bill, the Speakers of the two Houses of Parliament shall jointly resolve any question as to whether it is a bill concerning counties and if it is, whether it is a special or an ordinary bill.

However, National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi says he was kept in the dark.

“You look at some of them (bills) they are very good. But we must help Parliament legislate within the law and the constitution. We do not want people to challenge the bills in court once they have been passed,” said Mr Muturi.

Nevertheless, Speaker Muturi noted that the leadership of the two Houses need to sit down and agree on how best to advise its technical teams to try and save initiatives that may have a lot of benefit to the country.

But even as Speaker Muturi spoke, the leader of minority in the National Assembly John Mbadi (Suba South), former leader of majority Aden Duale (Garissa Township), Kimani Ichung’wah (Kikuyu) and Makali Mulu (Kitui Central) accused the Senate of violating the constitution. “It is a serious offence if any of us will allow a money bill to be introduced in the Senate. It is a treasonable offence not to disrespect the constitution and that is exactly what the Senate is doing,” said Mr Mbadi.

“The definition of “a money bill” has no ambiguity. Anything that deals with taxes, a charge on a public fund among others, is a preserve of this House,” said Mr Mbadi.

Mr Duale noted that this is not the first time the Senate is being reminded about constitutionalism.

“We don’t want to see the Senate look like some MCAs. Some of us would want to end in the Senate. If your neighbour misbehaves and you share the same compound you tell them. The Senate cannot violate the constitution and the PFM Act at will,” Mr Duale noted.

Mr Ichung’wah noted that the rejection of the bills has not been triggered on the motion of the House committee but the constitution.

“It is the constitution that has killed those bills,” Mr Ichung’wah said, adding, “It is not just an abuse of the parliamentary system but a waste of time and public resources for senators to sit in the House, debate and pass money bills that they know will go nowhere!”

Mr Mulu noted that the Senate needs to be helped so that it does things correctly and within the constitution.

The County Boundaries Bill seeks to define the boundaries of the counties, to provide for the resolution of disputes through the establishment of a county boundaries mediation committee.

The Office of the County Printer Bill has the principal object of establishing the office of the county printer in each of the 47 counties. The establishment of this office is necessitated by the provisions of the County Governments Act, 2012, which makes reference to publication of Bills, Acts and other documentation in a “county gazette”. "
David Mwere,"The demand for accountability in the use of billions of shillings allocated for Covid-19 interventions continues to gather momentum with the Commission on Administrative Justice (CAJ) and three former senators calling on the relevant government institutions to make full disclosure on the kitty.

Former senators Johnson Muthama, Dr Boni Khalwale and Mr Hassan Omar have particularly called on development partners to freeze funding to the kitty until the government explains how it is spending the money.

The calls by CAJ and the former senators come as a parliamentary committee directed Auditor-General Nancy Gathungu to undertake a special audit into the expenditure of the billions of shillings allocated to the national and county governments for the pandemic’s interventions.

CAJ, also known as the office of the Ombudsman, said that it is wrong for responsible institutions to misuse funds aimed at dealing with the pandemic and then failing to provide information on the amounts of money received from government loans or grants and resultant expenditures.

“The commission has noted with concern where public officers have been quoted declaring that they would not make disclosures on expenditure of Covid-19 funds. This is a blatant breach of the trust and erodes public confidence in the integrity of the public office,” Ms Florence Kajuju, the chairperson of CAJ said.

As Ms Kajuju spoke, the former senators led by Mr Muthama urged the international community and other donors to cut funding, arguing that the funds are not serving the intended purpose.

Mr Muthama noted that their agitation is not meant to punish Kenyans, claiming that the funds advanced to the country to help in the fight against the disease had not been directed to the intended use as the money has been stashed in offshore private accounts.

“This is the money that was intended to cushion Kenyans against this disease. But it has been stolen and stashed in overseas accounts,” said Mr Muthama even as the disease continues to decimate the global population and its economy.

The former Machakos senator claimed that in order to conceal the theft, the government has now resorted to confusing Kenyans with the 2022 succession politics.

“They are now diverting the attention of Kenyans from the theft of Covid-19 funds to the politics of 2022. But what we are saying is, let the government make full disclosure on how the funds were used before soliciting the same from donors,” he added.

Kenya has so far secured over Sh223 billion for its Covid-19 war chest from the international community.

This includes Sh78.3 billion from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Sh108 billion from the World Bank both as budgetary support and extra resources to help fight the deadly viral infection.

IMF had, before this financing, extended Sh6.8 billion support to the Health ministry for preparations and response while the African Development Bank gave Sh22.5 billion as a concessional loan with the European Union topping with Sh7.5 billion in form of grants.

Dr Khalwale claimed that the individuals connected to senior government and political figures have been raking in millions of shillings by selling donations earmarked for the pandemic interventions to the Kenya Medical Supplies Authority (Kemsa).

“The international community should readjust the model of funding to help fight this disease. Because of the theft, we are urging donors to channel their funding through community-based organisations, faith-based organisations and other non-governmental organisations,” Dr Khalwale said.

Mr Omar demanded that individuals at the Ministry of Health and Kemsa suspected of stealing the funds step aside for investigations to be done.

“What is happening is wanton and reckless theft of funds meant to help the country. Unless people are arrested and disclosures made, the donor community should suspend Covid-19 funding. We are only calling for accountability,” Mr Omar said.

The Senate ad hoc committee on Covid-19, in directing the Auditor-General to do a special audit, noted that the billions of shillings meant to deal with the disease may have been diverted to other areas not related to the pandemic, misapplied or misappropriated.

The committee chaired by nominated Senator Sylvia Kasanga also wants the Controller of Budget Margaret Nyakang’o to furnish it with a special budget review implementation report on the use of the funds meant for Covid-19 interventions by the 47 counties."
David Mwere,"The National Assembly was Wednesday divided over a committee's report  recommending the eviction of Kenya Defense Forces (KDF) from a disputed parcel in Roysambu, Nairobi.

The report of the House Committee on Lands, chaired by Kitui South MP Dr Rachael Nyamai, wants KDF to lose possession of the 17.16-acre land in Roysambu constituency for invading and evicting former workers on the land.

Other than KDF, it also emerged that Solio Construction Company Limited and Uchumi Supermarket among others are also interested parties in the land dispute.

However, what a majority of the MPs were uncomfortable with was a recommendation of the committee that the Ministry of Lands in consultation with the National Lands Commission (NLC) and Nairobi City County complete titling the land within 180 days of tabling the report.

The report was tabled on December 5, 2019, meaning that by now the titling, according to the committee, should have been done even before the report is either adopted or rejected by the report.

But MPs, Amos Kimunya (Kipipiri), Aden Duale (Garissa Township) and Opiyo Wandayi (Ugunja) took issue with the recommendation saying it will be wrong to evict KDF from the land.

They also argued that parliament has no such powers as they are only vested in the High Court.

“You cannot use parliament to sanitise some irregular allocations of the land. Any transaction over the land will have to be based on the law. If it is illegal, it will go nowhere,” Mr Kimunya told the House.

Mr Kimunya also noted that Attorney-General Kihara Kariuki has already issued an advisory indicating that the land in question is not available as it is already alienated to KDF.

The disputed land belonged to the late Mayer Jacob Samuels and had a lease of 99 years from November 1, 1904.

When it expired in 2003, it reverted to the national government.

Mr Kimunya told the House that the government acquired this land in 1986 compulsorily for defense department.

“Meetings took place to discuss compensation. Valuation was done. The government paid the Commissioner of Lands, who deposited the amount in court. The court then forwarded the amount for the owner. The owner confirmed receipt of the money,” he added.

The petitioners wanted the committee to investigate the eviction and invasion by KDF and any claim of ownership by any other interested party.

The petition also wanted the committee to order for compensation and demolition of the petitioners’ premises and any other relief that may be available.

But Mr Duale questioned the findings of the committee saying they were not only illegal but unconstitutional.

“Why would anyone want to evict KDF from such land? The recommendations of the committee cannot stand as it would be tantamount to clothing the committee with jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 165 of the Constitution,” said Mr Duale.

Mr Duale noted that when the lease expired on November 1, 2003, “the land was cleverly allocated to the “workers” who used to work in the farm.

“Nothing can be as clear as this. This is pure fraud,” Mr Duale noted.

Ironically, said Mr Duale, the committee chose to ignore “this critical fact” and upheld the rights of the petitioners who were former workers on the land in question further demonstrating the mystery surrounding the petition.

The Garissa Township MP warned the House against encroaching on the jurisdiction of the courts.

“What is also rather obvious from the report is that the petition is one of convoluted and inter-twinned spider web. We should not be seen as conferring ourselves authority or powers that the Constitution did not confer upon us as this would be tantamount to redrafting the Constitution,” he said.

According to Mr Duale, the country should be told who deported the sons of the owner when he died noting that individuals behind owners of Solio Construction Company limited and the role of Uchumi supermarkets in this dispute must be told.

However, MPs Ndirangu Waihenya (Roy Sambu), who filed the petition on behalf of the former workers, and Antony Oluoch (Mathare) said justice must be done on the former workers.

“The former workers must be issued with title deeds,” Mr Ndirangu said with Mr Oluoch noting that though KDF claims to have paid Sh3 million for the acquisition of the land, “the receipts claiming to support the transaction is questionable.”

Other than titling, the committee also recommended that the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) probes the officers in the Ministry of Lands who may have caused loss of public funds by effecting fraudulent transactions.

That the DPP prosecutes any person found culpable within 90 days of tabling of the report."
David Mwere,"A proposal to have the third basis formula for allocating funds to county governments deferred for two years failed after senators voted against it Tuesday. 

The latest development came as Siaya Senator James Orengo accused President Uhuru Kenyatta for being inaccessible at the time the House needed his guidance.

The report of the Finance and Budget Committee that considered the formula as developed by the Commission on Revenue Allocation (CRA) had recommended that the formula that will see counties with huge population gain while those with huge land mass and smaller population lose, be applied from 2021/22 financial year.

However, an amendment by Murang’a Senator Kang’ata Irungu saw the majority of the Senators vote against it.

By the time of going to press, the committee was discussing the report by the committee chaired by Kirinyaga Senator Charles Kibiru as originally moved.

Tuesday's attempt by the Senate was the sixth time in a month the lawmakers were trying to pass the new formula.

But before adopting the report, the senators will be required to deal with an amendment by Makueni Senator Mutula Kilonzo Junior that seeks to cushion counties from losing any allocation.

However, many have opposed it on the basis that it is not a subject of public participation and could therefore raise a constitutional issue if adopted, as it drastically alters the formula by CRA according to Article 271 (1) of the constitution.

“I urge the Senators to pass this formula. This is the minimum you can ever take to the counties,” Mr Kibiru noted.

Under the CRA proposal, 29 counties are gaining while 18 are losing out on the new formula that is a radical shift from the first and second as it expands the parameters for the shareable revenue among the counties.

Going by the CRA parameters, it means that counties with high poverty levels and small populations will lose out on the equitable horizontal share compared to those with high populations.

Earlier attempts by leader of minority James Orengo (Siaya) and Moses Wetang’ula (Bungoma) to have debate on the committee report deferred to another sitting was shot down by 40 senators against seven.

While contributing to Mr Kang’ata’s amendment, Mr Orengo had said that a little more time would have served to build consensus among the Senators for an agreeable formula.

“I am totally disappointed today because we do not know where we are going. I have been pleading to members, let’s be smart, like Justice Odunga says- like a guided missile. The figures they show, I can tell you that if population was the measure, it is not what counties with high populations are getting,” Mr Orengo said.

Mr Orengo said had the President been accessible, the divisive nature of the new formula would not have been witnessed.

“We have lost our minds. We would not be here if the president was accessible. I am not saying it for me but for the country,” the Siaya Senator noted.

Leader of Majority Samuel Poghisio also supported noting that marginalization has been cured by the amendment.

“This formula profits the so-called losers more than the gainers. Had we not politicized this matter, we would have reached a middle ground,” Mr Poghisio noted. 

According to CRA, the new formula is meant to enhance service delivery, promote balanced development, and incentivize counties to optimize capacity to raise revenue as well as incentivize prudent use of public resources.

According to the sixth schedule of the constitution, the first and second determinations of the basis of the division of revenue among the counties shall be made at three year intervals rather than every five years as provided for in Article 271 (1) of the constitution.

Subsequent formulae shall, however, be applicable after five years.

The first basis Formula was passed by the National Assembly on November 27, 2012, to serve for 3 years but instead it served for four years- 2013/14, 2014/15, 2015/16 and 2016/17.

The sharing was based on five parameters- population 45 percent, poverty gap 20 percent, land area 8 percent, basic equal share 25 percent and fiscal responsibility 2 percent.

It sought to achieve service delivery and redistribution of resources.

The formula was largely tailor-made to reward poverty and as such counties slackened on development as they competed to be poor so that they could get enhanced allocation.

The second basis formula passed by parliament on July 6, 2016 – to serve for 3 years 2017/18, 2018/19 and 2019/20. It was based on six parameters- basic equal share 26 percent, population 45 percent, land area 8 percent, poverty 18 percent, fiscal effort 2 percent and development factor 1 percent.

It was designed to provide adequate funding to enable county governments undertake functions assigned to them, correct economic disparities and minimize the development gap.

It was also meant to stimulate economic optimization and incentivize counties to optimise capacity to raise revenue.

Justus Ochieng,"Some employees of the Ministry of ICT, Innovations and Youth Affairs from counties, who went on an official trip to the US last year, are up in arms alleging discrimination in the payment of foreign travel allowances.

The affected staff said they attended trainings on different dates in the US states of Arizona and Washington, DC, together with county commissioners, county police commanders, representatives of other security agencies and officials from the Ministry of ICT headquarters.

Before embarking on the trip, they said, ICT Cabinet Secretary Joe Mucheru, in a letter, undertook to settle the allowances as per the existing regulations.

According to the letter seen by the Nation referenced MICT/Gen. /2/4 (40) and signed by the CS, the ministry committed to cater for their per diem as ""per the stipulated rate in the SRC (Salaries and Remuneration Commission) formula"".

""Clearance is hereby granted for you to participate in the public affairs consultative visit to the United States of America Joint Task Force West (JTF-W) in Tucson, Arizona to learn about the ongoing government programmes on border security and observe border operations and communications from 14th to 21st September, 2019,"" states CS Mucheru's letter.

“With the assurance from the CS, we left for the foreign country for the training that brought together county commissioners, county police commanders and county information officers from the border counties with the hope that we would be paid what we are entitled to once we landed back,"" the affected employees told the Nation on Thursday. Whereas the field officers left without the quarter per diem, some ""officials from the ICT headquarters went abroad with their allowances fully paid in advance"".

""On return, we provided the relevant documents including air tickets, boarding passes and copies of passports for reimbursement of the allowances but the ministry has since kept mum and no amount of inquiries would make the Teleposta Towers officials to act,"" they said.

What irks the field officers most is the fact that officials based at Teleposta Towers who made the trip have had their claims settled while they are kept in the dark with nobody eager to handle their matter.

“The trip was made in the 2019/2020 financial year and the headquarters staff deliberately refused to pay our dues. Will we ever be paid?” asked one of the affected staff who said that one of them died mid this year after waiting in vain for the allowances to enable him cater for medication.

The officers called for fair treatment by the ministry’s top officials and the immediate payment of their dues.

“We have made enquiries from our colleagues from other departments who were on the trip and we have learnt that they were paid their quarter per diems and we are wondering whether the government has a different circular from the existing one by SRC that stipulates the allowances that a government worker is entitled to,"" they lamented.

On Thursday, CS Mucheru said he is not aware that some staff who attended the training have not been paid.

""I can only pursue the matter if I have the names of the affected staff,"" he said, adding, “If they cannot disclose who they are, then let the media come to their aid.""

But the affected officers told Nation that the CS's reference letter is enough to enable him do the follow up.

""We cannot go public for fear of victimisation but we were entitled to the pay and nothing should stop the ministry from addressing our plight,"" said one official."
Justus Ochieng,"The Jubilee party will not field a candidate in the Msambweni Parliamentary by-election slated for December 15, 2020.

Party Secretary-General Raphael Tuju says this is due to the current debate on dissolution of Parliament over the two-thirds gender rule and party leader Uhuru Kenyatta's handshake deal with Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) leader Raila Odinga.

This comes days after Chief Justice David Maraga petitioned President Kenyatta to dissolve Parliament over its failure to pass laws to activate the two-thirds gender rule for all elected and appointive positions. 

In his advice to the President, the CJ said that the mechanism for the dissolution of Parliament, irrespective of the consequences, is the radical remedy that Kenyans desired in order to incentivise the political elites to adhere to and fully operationalise the transformational agenda of the Constitution.

""The country has very serious constitutional matters to deal with that will require sobrierty and reaching across the political divide in order to navigate our beloved country across some of these challenges,"" Mr Tuju said in the statement issued on Wednesday.

The seat fell vacant following the death of legislator Suleiman Dori in  March this year.

Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) Chairman Wafula Chebukati said the by-election, which was postponed in April, will be held on December 15.

The electoral body said elections of Ward representatives for Kahawa Wendani, Kisumu North, Dabaso, Wundanyi and LakeView will also be held on the same day.

Mr Tuju, however, said the party's decision on Msambweni does not affect the Ward elections.

Justus Ochieng,"Major political parties have cracked the whip on rebels as realignments ahead of the 2022 General Election take shape. 

The ruling Jubilee, Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) and Wiper Democratic Movement–Kenya are taking a raft of measures to ensure discipline and loyalty to the party is restored.

Wiper and Kanu are the latest parties to fire warning shots to dissidents as Kalonzo Musyoka and Gideon Moi move to stamp their authority. 

Wiper has issued a 14-day ultimatum to Makueni Governor Prof Kivutha Kibwana and his deputy, Adelina Mwau, to clear their membership fee arrears or face disciplinary action.

In letters seen by the Nation, Wiper has demanded Sh600,000 from Prof Kibwana and Sh1,050,000 from Ms Mwau. Prof Kibwana defaulted between January 2019 and August 2020, while Ms Mwau has failed to pay subscriptions from October 2017 to August 2020. “We write to notify you that despite several reminders to you, you have failed, refused and or neglected to honour or pay the said subscriptions which is in contravention of Article 29 (g) Wiper Democratic Movement – Kenya Constitution and the party’s certificate of pledge that you signed committing yourself to offer financial support to party activities and programmes,” state the letters signed by Wiper Secretary-General Judith Sijeny.

In Kanu, party national organising secretary Abdulrahman Bafadhil on Thursday said West Pokot Governor John Lonyangapuo, who was elected on the party’s ticket, had not only failed to submit his contributions, but was also campaigning for Deputy President William Ruto. “Lonyangapuo should respect the party that earned him the governor’s seat. He owes the party close to Sh1.6 million,” Mr Bafadhil said.

Emurua Dikirr MP Johanna Ng’eno is also in trouble.  Kanu secretary-general Nick Salat asked him to resign from the party or face expulsion over his unsavoury remarks on the first family.

Jubilee has also cracked the whip on at least five rebel senators who snubbed a Parliamentary Group meeting that ousted Kipchumba Murkomen and Susan Kihika from Majority Leader and Chief Whip positions respectively.

In ODM, Malindi MP Aisha Jumwa continues to challenge her expulsion from the party in court."
Justus Ochieng,"The ODM party has resolved to have Migori Governor Okoth Obado impeached over graft claims.

Party chairman John Mbadi told the Nation that a total of 37 out of the 41 ODM ward reps, who attended a consultative meeting in Nairobi, agreed to have the governor removed from office.

Four ODM MCAs could not attend the meeting, Mr Mbadi said.

On Monday, Chief Magistrate Lawrence Mugambi of the Milimani Anti-corruption Court freed Obado on Sh8.7 million cash bail or an alternative Sh20 million bond and prohibited him from travelling outside the country.

Following the developments, ODM, which has a majority in the Migori County Assembly, invited its members for an urgent “consultative meeting” in Nairobi Tuesday.

ODM said on Twitter that the deputy governor of Migori will have to take over because the governor is not only fighting corruption claims but that he has been barred from accessing his office. Mr Obado is also on trial for the murder of former Rongo University girlfriend Sharon Otieno and her unborn son."
Justus Ochieng,"President Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga are turning to religious leaders in their bid to boost support for the planned referendum amid opposition from Deputy President William Ruto.

The two principals, whose March 9, 2018 ‘Handshake’ birthed the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI), are counting on clergy support to push their agenda after delays linked to the Covid-19 pandemic.

In 2010, the DP used a similar tactic when he rallied religious leaders against the referendum on the draft Constitution, which Kenyans ended up backing overwhelmingly.

The Nation has established that President Kenyatta and Mr Odinga are set to reactivate regional campaign teams that will push the case for the plebiscite.

“The teams that were set up before the pandemic are still in place and will be tasked with publicising the document once it’s handed over to the two principals,” ODM Director of Elections and Campaigns, Junet Mohamed, told Nation on Monday. The teams will be bolstered by the civil society, trade unionists, elders, youth and women.

During his 11th speech on the pandemic last week, Mr Kenyatta underscored the need to amend the Constitution. He said that in the next three weeks, Kenya will chart its post-Covid-19 future. In January during a visit to Mombasa, President Kenyatta had unveiled regional teams, mainly consisting of governors and Cabinet secretaries to take charge of countrywide BBI campaigns, with Mr Odinga in command.

The Coast region is headed by Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho, Western (Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya and Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa), Eastern (Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu) and in Mount Kenya Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru and Agriculture CS Peter Munya were put in charge.

Elgeyo-Marakwet Governor Alex Tolgos heads the Rift Valley, supposedly working closely with Kanu Chairman Gideon Moi. In North Eastern, the BBI team will rely on its steering committee chairman, Mr Yusuf Haji, and Eldas MP Aden Keynan, the Jubilee parliamentary group secretary.

Interior CS Fred Matiang’i is expected to lead the charge in Nyanza, while Nominated MP Maina Kamanda will mobilise support in Nairobi under Mr Odinga’s close supervision.

Already, ODM and Jubilee youth and women leagues have been brought on board and are planning rallies countrywide, targeting the youth and women.

On August 18, Mr Odinga met Narok ODM youth leader Dickson Sarbabi at his Capitol Hill office in Nairobi where they discussed the BBI process.

Mr Odinga is said to have briefed them on plans to involve the young generation in the BBI process. On March 12, Mr Odinga hosted trade unionists, led by Cotu Secretary-General Francis Atwoli, at his office to explore BBI execution paths. “I met with leaders... to deliberate on issues of common interest that they have raised with the BBI steering committee,” Mr Odinga said during his brief after the meeting.

Mr Atwoli has been in the forefront advocating for the implementation of the document that is set to be unveiled “soon”, according to sources at State House.

The ODM leader has also held several meetings with Gema Council of Elders to rally them behind the proposed referendum.

Mr Kenyatta is counting on the support of Cabinet secretaries, whom he directed last year to ensure their respective ministries implement interventions envisaged in the BBI.

Head of Public Service Joseph Kinyua, in a circular addressed to all CSs and the Attorney-General, listed support for BBI among key areas of appraisal for ministries, departments and their agencies.

Among the issues the teams are expected to debunk are claims by Dr Ruto and his Tangatanga troops that constitutional change is not a priority. The DP is already laying ground to oppose the initiative. On Sunday, he enlisted religious leaders as allies in his opposition to the BBI and calls for a plebiscite.

In 2010, he capitalised on clauses in the draft Constitution that differed with religious doctrine, including abortion, to unite men of the cloth to oppose the document.

“The BBI document was taken back and we don’t know whether it will come the way it was or it will be altered,” the DP said last week, giving his strongest signal yet that he would oppose changes to the Law. But the opposition is unlikely to stop changes that do not require a referendum.  

“One thing that may come out is that some of the proposals of the BBI would call for certain administrative actions to be taken which don’t require any vote,” ODM National Chairman John Mbadi said.

ODM Secretary-General Edwin Sifuna said they expect increase of funds to counties, address of gender question proposals for boosting the management of the affairs of the country, including electoral justice, to be addressed through BBI.

“We’re also looking forward to ensure the role of political parties in the appointment of commissioners is addressed,” Mr Sifuna said.

But Jubilee Deputy Secretary-General Caleb Kositany said amending the constitution is not a priority for Kenyans. 

“With challenges Kenyans are undergoing now, the state of economy, Covid-19 situation and the fact that there’s a lot of secrecy in the BBI movement, I don’t think amending the constitution now is towards the right direction,” said Mr Kositany. "
Justus Ochieng,"As the war on corruption escalates, Deputy President William Ruto and Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) leader Raila Odinga have found themselves in uncomfortable positions.

Dr Ruto has taken on the government following reports that connected individuals benefited from money meant for coronavirus patients.

Mr Odinga, on the other hand, fended off accusations levelled at his allies and Handshake partner President Uhuru Kenyatta, drawing criticism that he has abdicated his oversight duties.

Early in the week, Mr Odinga asked for a special audit of the Covid-19 funds use as Kenyans demanded that heads roll.

During his address to the nation on Wednesday, President Kenyatta said corruption needs to be tackled if the country is to realise economic growth.

Dr Ruto, who has been on the receiving end of corruption allegations, has now turned the heat on Mr Odinga over the Kenya Medical Supplies Authority (Kemsa) scandal, accusing him of speaking from both sides of the mouth. Yet during an interview on Citizen TV on Thursday, Dr Ruto said institutions charged with fighting corruption should be allowed to do their work.

“They do not need ODM to do an audit. The former opposition should keep off. I’m happy they have now realised that drama and sensationalisation should not be part of investigations. It is fine they have come to that realisation,” the DP said.

ODM in turn, accused Dr Ruto of shifting goal posts on corruption.

“The position of the party...is that the government needs to conduct a thorough and urgent audit of the funds put at the disposal of State agencies, departments and ministries to fight the pandemic,” Mr Odinga said.

Dr Ruto’s position appears to be contradictory. He criticised the same State agencies, including the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI), in March. At one time, he took to his Twitter handle, dismissing the corruption investigations.

“The DCI has been mobilised to for political reasons to discredit and destroy my office with all manner of nonsense and to bring me down,” Dr Ruto’s tweeted as some of his allies were being investigated.

During the Thursday TV interview, he defended himself against accusations of having no stand on corruption matters.

“My position is consistent…I have been opposed from day one to criminal investigations being profiled in the media. For purposes of ensuring these investigations are credible and not politicised, they are supposed to be professional,” he said.

“Surprisingly, ODM today has joined me to say there should be no sensationalisation. Then they said I was interfering with investigations.”

Friday, ODM Secretary General Edwin Sifuna told the Saturday Nation that Dr Ruto remains the biggest enemy of State institutions charged with fighting corruption.

“He has called the DCI a political youth wing hired to kill him. He has dismissed the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission as a tool for political convenience and has labelled the Director of Criminal Investigations an anti-Ruto machine,” Mr Sifuna said.

“He has consistently sought to delegitimise institutions that are crucial to justice, security and stability so as to avoid accountability.”

Mumias East MP Benjamin Washiali questioned the reasons Mr Odinga “has dumped Kenyans whom he claimed to speak for in the past”.

“Where are the whistle blowing credentials of Raila Odinga?” the Mumias East lawmaker asked. "
Justus Ochieng,"Thirdway Alliance leader Ekuru Aukot is fighting to retain his position after the party’s National Executive Committee (NEC) announced his suspension Tuesday.

Thirdway Alliance has joined a list of outfits experiencing coups.

Party secretary general Fredrick Okang’o and chairman Miruru Waweru said Thirdway Alliance suspended Dr Aukot indefinitely.

The officials said the NEC considered complaints raised against Dr Aukot by members.

One of the complaints was that the party leader used “crude words” against his deputy Angela Mwikali. They also mentioned financial impropriety and self-enrichment.

Dr Aukot dismissed the suspension, saying the two are being used by external forces to coerce him into supporting the Building Bridges Initiative.

"
Justus Ochieng,"Wiper Democratic Movement party leader Kalonzo Musyoka is walking a tight rope in his political career as he works out his 2022 matrix.

The former vice President, whose party signed a cooperation deal with the ruling Jubilee Party in June, is not sitting pretty among his new-found allies in the Handshake.

In his backyard, he is also facing a growing rebellion, with some of his allies harbouring presidential ambitions.

The man from Tseikuru is slowly becoming a general without troops if the revolt in Ukambani is anything to go by.

Former Machakos Senator Johnson Muthama, a long-time confidant, has broken ranks with the former VP and endorsed Deputy President William Ruto for President in 2022 because “Wiper party has no stamina to make one President”. “My free advice to Kalonzo: When the campaign time comes around, we want to see you as a presidential candidate hosting rallies at Uhuru Park, Afraha Stadium and the Tononoka grounds. Ukambani village-based campaigns cannot get you to State House,” Mr Muthama said, generating a barrage of criticism from loyal Wiper followers.

Mr Musyoka is also not on the same page with the three Ukambani governors; Charity Ngilu (Kitui), Alfred Mutua (Machakos) and Kivutha Kibwana (Makueni). Both Dr Mutua and Prof Kibwana have declared interest in the 2022 presidential seat, further muddying the waters for the Wiper leader. But the party’s head of communications, Mr Onesmus Kilonzo, insists Mr Musyoka still commands a huge following.

Mr Muthama and his ilk, Mr Kilonzo said, had better be advised to look at the trail of wounded politicians who have tried to wrestle with Mr Musyoka in his political backyard.

“I won’t mention them to preserve the little dignity they still have, but they appear to have completely lost interest in politics. Others are looking for ways to mend fences with Kalonzo. Kalonzo’s backyard is tightly locked for him in 2022,” said Mr Kilonzo.

In the Handshake, Mr Musyoka is also under fire over his “relevance in the camp”.

Vocal Jubilee Vice Chairman David Murathe feels Mr Musyoka has not lived up to his expectation of working with Jubilee “inside and outside Parliament”, referring to the revenue sharing formula impasse.

“These people know the party position so far as revenue formula is concerned but have chosen to go against it, in other words we are not walking together,” Mr Murathe told the Nation.

“ODM has not signed any agreement with Jubilee and only works with us based on the Handshake and good faith, yet Raila is sticking his neck out for Mt Kenya. What business do we have with Wiper?” he posed. To pile on his woes, Mr Musyoka is not in good books with the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM). ODM recently denied claims by the former VP that Mr Odinga had a secret 2022 pact with him, generating a bitter exchange between the two parties.

ODM’s Edwin Sifuna argued that Mr Musyoka was seeking to “reap where he did not sow” while Wiper’s Judith Sijeny accused Mr Sifuna of authoring a statement tailored to malign Mr Musyoka’s character.

Mr Murathe’s endorsement of Mr Odinga had also generated a lot of heat, with Mr Musyoka’s Wiper cautioning leaders against making utterances that can threaten the unity of the country and derail the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) process.

Wiper Vice Chairman Victor Swanya said that Mr Murathe holds a lot of influence and can sway the thinking of Kenyans and must exhibit caution.

“He is a respected leader and what he utters has a lot of weight. Leaders should be responsible in their talk so that they don’t make statements that are destructive in nature or probably create unnecessary conflicts in the country,” Mr Swanya said.

“We are not worried because we know, at the right time, we will table our request to Kenyans and other leaderships. Kalonzo has successfully executed his mandate as an outstanding Foreign Affairs Minister and Vice President and we ask our colleagues not to undermine the cordial relationship in the Handshake and the BBI process,” he added."
Justus Ochieng,"President Uhuru Kenyatta has finally vanquished his deputy William Ruto in the fight for control of Jubilee Party, leaving the country’s second in command with only one option – to find a new political vehicle for his 2022 presidential race.

Sources at the party’s headquarters say that President Kenyatta now has firm grip on the party after some of the “DP’s remnants” were either kicked out or stripped of powers.

The President has also succeeded in reconstituting the party’s National Executive Committee (NEC) and the National Management Committee (NMC).

After months of persistent onslaught on the DP, which saw his allies kicked out of key parliamentary positions, the President embarked on a clean-up at the party headquarters, forcing Dr Ruto’s Tangatanga camp to seek refuge at the Jubilee Asili Centre in Kilimani, Nairobi.

The Sunday Nation has established that a key DP ally since their days at the United Republican Party, Mr Joseph Mulili, who had been serving as the Jubilee deputy finance director, has been kicked out over claims of “leaking crucial party information.” “Such information has not been substantiated but has been constantly used to tarnish the reputation of the ruling party and its leader. That is unacceptable,” said a party insider.

Mr Mulili declined to comment on the issue when the Sunday Nation reached him.

Mr Nick Bore, Jubilee Party’s director of membership stationed at the party’s Pangani office, was also deprived of crucial duties over claims of having links with Dr Ruto.

“Nicodemus Bore has the title but no power,” a source at the party headquarters privy to the happenings there told the Sunday Nation.

“He has since been denied access to crucial membership data held at the Registrar of Political Parties domain. All these are efforts to ensure discipline and loyalty to the party leader.”

But Mr Bore denied the claims but refused to discuss the matter further.

“Not true,” he curtly said.

But Jubilee Party deputy secretary-general Mr Caleb Kositany, the DP’s de facto spokesman, declared the changes in the NEC illegal.

“For any changes, there must be an NEC meeting, which we haven’t had. It is therefore illegal and, to us, the NEC remains as it was,” said Mr Kositany, who is the MP for Soy Constituency in Uasin Gishu County.

Jubilee’s Majority chief whip Mr Irungu Kang’ata said the party was within its mandate to make substitutions in the NEC after “some members left.”

“For instance,” he said, “Kipchumba Murkomen, who was the Senate Majority leader, having been dropped and the fact that we cannot bring in Samuel Poghisio because he belongs in Kanu, there was a need to look for another person to join the NEC.” 

Party secretary-general Raphael Tuju said officials of the Jubilee Coalition only come on board when they meet as a coalition and not as a party.

“Within the context of the coalition, when we are meeting, the Kanu team that got positions automatically come on board, but when we are meeting as a party they also have their party,” Mr Tuju said.

“Just like in Nasa, when Wiper wants to meet as Wiper they do so and when they meet as Nasa then ODM and the rest have to be there.”  The DP’s allies in May took the war to President Kenyatta’s doorstep with a barrage of damaging revelations, including an exposè on how a company associated with the president’s relatives was awarded a multimillion-shilling tender to supply key campaign materials in the run-up to the 2017 elections.

Mr Kositany has also accused the party of corruption and failing to publish its financial records.

President Kenyatta has of late resorted to using a slim number of individuals and officials and non-officials in the party to execute his plans.

Some of the men and women behind the operations to clean up the party and now the faces behind the Jubilee coup are deputy chief of staff Mr Njee Muturi, presidential adviser Nancy Gitau, Mr Tuju, chairman Nelson Dzuya and vice-chairman David Murathe.

Others are Jubilee regional director in charge of Eastern Mount Kenya Francis Mwindani, his Kiambu counterpart and East African Legislative Assembly regional director Mr Steve Mwanga, Head of Finance and Administration Wambui Gichuru, lawyer Tom Macharia and deputy State House comptroller George Kariuki.

Mr Muturi, Ms Gitau, Mr Tuju and Mr Murathe are said to have the ear of the President.

They brief him on technical matters and are the executors of crucial decisions on behalf of the President not only in the party but also in the day-to-day running of government. Ms Gichuru, who is the financial controller in Jubilee Party, is said to be also involved in critical decision making in the party and finances its activities while Mr Mwindani and Mr Mwanga sit on the party’s dispute resolution committee.

With the changes in the NEC, the President’s camp now hopes to ratify party decisions with ease.

Nominated senators who defied President Kenyatta’s invite for a Jubilee Parliamentary Group Meeting in May could be the first casualties of the reconstituted NEC after the party’s disciplinary committee recommended their expulsion.

The legislators on Kenyatta’s chopping block are Millicent Omanga, Mary Seneta Yiane, Falhada Dekow Iman, Naomi Jillo Waqo and Victor Prengei. The NEC is expected to have the last word on the senators and could seal their fate.

All the six members of the National Management Committee — Lucy Nyawira Macharia, Prof Marete Marangu, Walter Nyambati, Jane Nampaso and James Waweru — have automatically joined the party’s NEC as per the party’s constitution, according to Mr Tuju.

“There are people who had left because either they got jobs in government, so it was kind of conflicting. When they left, we replaced them but with the full knowledge of the board,” Mr Tuju told Sunday Nation.

His deputy Mr Kositany maintains that this action was illegal.

“All members of the NMC are automatically members of the NEC,” said the party spokesman.

He said it is wrong for some party officials to protest the reconstitution of the NEC when they also got the positions through a similar process.

“They were also appointed the same way. It’s like me now saying that nobody should be appointed to the NEC and my position as SG was done under the same transitional clause.”

Justus Ochieng,"Politician Raila Odinga’s party has told off Deputy President William Ruto following his remarks on allegations of corruption in the procurement of Covid-19 supplies.

Dr Ruto Thursday distanced himself from the “theft of Covid-19 billions” and said that “at least for once it won't be possible to be blamed for what someone said started in Wuhan as a virus, landed in Italy as a pandemic and is now in Kenya as a multi-billion shilling corruption enterprise”.

""Wacha niendelee kama spectator. (Let me continue being a spectator). It's right,"" the DP also wrote on his Twitter page.

On Saturday, the Orange Democratic Movement said it was ""disheartening to hear no less a senior government official than the Deputy President go public with a “juvenile and improper statement” about not being blamed for the mess.

Through Secretary-General Edwin Sifuna, Mr Odinga’s party said the DP suggested it is okay for the funds to be stolen as long as he is not the one to blame.

""Even more unsettling [is that his remarks] express the jealousy of being left out of the gravy train,"" Mr Sifuna said.
Mr Sifuna further accused Dr Ruto of having an uncooperative attitude and lacking political emotional intelligence, aspects which he said hinder the government’s smooth operations.

""At a time when he should help the President crack the whip on corruption cartels within government, he holds campaigns at his residence while cheering wrongdoing within government in the mistaken belief that any perceived failures by the President will raise his dwindling profile.""

The DP, the ODM official said, must either rise to the occasion and play the role of DP or ship out and let the President work in peace.

""We will keep raising any concerns we have about government operations, specifically Covid-19-related issues, through the proper channels, without unnecessary drama and hubris,” he said, adding Mr Odinga’s party will not merely condemn the government but will keep probing and defending the Kenyans; rights to efficient government services through correct processes.

""For that reason, we ask that media houses and other news agencies exercise responsibility in their coverage, because sensational and baseless reports may compromise international support for our Covid-19 war, endangering ordinary Kenyans and not just the leaders,” he said.

""Any information of wrongdoing must be passed to the rightful agencies for clear action.”

The ODM official further noted the need for the Auditor-General to review media reports on corruption at the Kenya Medical Supplies Agency (Kemsa).

On August 14, the Kemsa board suspended chief executive Jonah Manjari and directors Eliud Muriithi (commercial) and Charles Jume (procurement) amid investigations by the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) into alleged procurement irregularities and funds misuse.

Mr Sifuna explained that the media often ""goes on a sensationalist extravaganza, with half-baked information obtained from shadowy sources, ending up creating more problems than solutions”.

""Suffice it to say that all Kenyans of goodwill have found these allegations disturbing and thoroughly demoralising, at a time when we are losing more lives to the virus,"" said Mr Sifuna.

""We gather that the DCI has been called into Kemsa to investigate these matters. We, however, wonder how this can be so before a credible audit by the Auditor-General is carried out to ascertain the veracity of these claims.”

Regarding the prices of the protective gear, he said it makes sense that prices were lower before the pandemic ravaged the world.

“Any procurement happening in the current time has to come with higher values,” he said, adding higher costs cannot be the basis  for doubting the probity of those who undertook procurement.

"
Justus Ochieng,"The uncertainty on whether ODM leader Raila Odinga will be on the ballot in 2022 is attracting other presidential contenders to chip away at his Nyanza support base.

Mr Odinga has competed in every election since 1997, except in 2002 when he endorsed retired president Mwai Kibaki. However, as he has kept his supporters guessing – insisting it was not time to talk about 2022 – some of his prospective opponents are making attempts to lure voters from his Nyanza base.

Deputy President William Ruto, Kanu Chairman Gideon Moi and Amani National Congress (ANC) leader Musalia Mudavadi are some of the political bigwigs who are now eyeing the region.

Mr Ruto had made several trips to the Gusii region but not in Luo Nyanza. But he now seems to have intensified the targeting of the youth in Luo Nyanza to take his “hustler” campaign to the area.

Under the Nyanza Youth Movement for Ruto 2022, the team which was hosted at Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi’s home early this month has started campaigns for the DP in the area and are planning to host him.

Jubilee Deputy Secretary General Caleb Kositany told the Sunday Nation that the DP will crisscross the entire country to hunt for votes and that no region shall be left behind in their push for votes.

“We will take the hustler message in every part of the country because we are all Kenyans,” Mr Kositany said.

Massive membership recruitment

Mr Stephen Midenyo, who leads the Nyanza Youth Movement for Ruto 2022, said they were planning a series of activities in the area including fundraisers for churches, youth and women groups that will be presided over by the DP.

Mr Moi’s Kanu has also embarked on massive membership recruitment drive in the Nyanza region in what officials say is an attempt  to restore its lost glory in the area. Kanu Nyanza regional coordinator Tom Ojanga hosted a delegation of party officials from the region in Nairobi where they resolved to mobilise and recruit members to cement Mr Moi’s 2022 candidature for president.

“Kanu is the only party that can guarantee the unity and stability of the country going forward.”

“It is the only political vehicle which is non divisive, acceptable and present in all corners of the country,” Mr Ojanga, a former Mr Odinga confidant and coordinator of the ODM International Network.

He added that Kanu had embarked on enrolments and creation of branches in Nyanza region.

 “I am confident Kanu will be able to field candidates in all elective positions in Nyanza in 2022 and I believe it will do unexpectedly very well,” he said.

Mr Ojanga told Sunday Nation that going forward, there is need for a political formation that can guarantee national cohesion and unity of the people of Kenya.

Homa Bay County Kanu branch Chairman Ken Okul said they will revive all the county offices within the next month.

The party also recently launched a digital platform to boost recruitment.

For Mr Mudavadi’s ANC, Deputy party leader Ayub Savula told Sunday Nation that the party will also be taking 2022 campaigns to Nyanza region to win their support.

“Our party leader was recently endorsed by the National Governing Council as the party's presidential candidate for 2022 elections and we have since started a rigorous process to open offices in Mount Kenya and our next stop will be in Nyanza,” Mr Savula says.

He said Mr Mudavadi had supported Mr Odinga in the past two elections and it is now time for the ODM leader to reciprocate.

Jubilee Vice Chairman David Murathe recently told Kenyans to reward Mr Odinga “for all his struggles and sacrifices for the country’s democratic growth and progress.”

His sentiments were later echoed by Cotu Secretary General Francis Atwoli.

"
Justus Ochieng,"Deputy President William Ruto and his campaign advisers are racking their brains on who to pick as his running mate, with national appeal and the number of votes likely to be brought to the table among the top considerations.

Keen to ensure his first stab at the presidency is successful, the Nation understands that the team is seeking a person who is strong enough to run for the top office and who commands a political constituency that’s large enough to boost their candidate’s chances.

Another crucial decision the team is grappling with is the party to use for the presidential race.

DP Ruto was initially said to be keen on a running mate from the Mount Kenya region or Western, but his targets have since decamped, lost national influence or fallen out of favour.

The Nation understands that the DP’s Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) has already given its opinion on possible candidates. Former Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale said negotiations and consultations were ongoing, but no name had been settled on yet.

“Because we’re trying to dismantle ethnic mobilisation, having chosen to drive a national agenda, region of birth for the suitable candidate is not a strength. So far, the position has not been offered to anyone,” Dr Khalwale said.

In Mount Kenya, Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru’s name had been fronted before she fell out with the DP and established herself on the Handshake side, right next to his bitter foe, Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) party leader Raila Odinga.

Former Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Mwangi Kiunjiuri, who recently formed The Service Party, has also been mentioned.

Analysts, however, think Mr Kiunjuri would not be of much help to the DP if President Kenyatta—who has all but confirmed he might renege on his promise to back the DP for the top job in 2022—stamps his authority.

In Western, the DP was said to have been eyeing Amani National Congress (ANC) leader Musalia Mudavadi. So rife were the talks of a Ruto-Musalia ticket that the surprise resignations of Barrack Muluka and Eliud Owalo from ANC were quickly linked to a bid by the DP to woo the former deputy prime minister. Mr Mudavadi has rubbished these claims.

Wednesday, his deputy in the party, Lugari MP Ayub Savula, said Mr Mudavadi remains the ANC’s undisputed flag bearer.

 “We resolved to dissociate ourselves from Ruto and we’re fully behind Mudavadi’s 2022 candidature as we cooperate with President Kenyatta’s administration,” Mr Savula told the Nation.

At the Coast, the Ruto brigade, led by Malindi MP Aisha Jumwa, is raring to form a new party. Yesterday, Ms Jumwa was non-committal on whether the party would work with the DP and produce a running mate for him.

Political analyst Herman Manyora says the DP remains in a state of quagmire as political bigwigs are allied to President Kenyatta and Mr Odinga’s Handshake team.

“Any association with Ruto comes at a high cost. The biggest challenge he has is the pariah status he’s being pushed into. The system is making it very difficult for people to want to work with him,” Prof Manyora says.

He argues that the DP is also in a dilemma as the vote-rich Mount Kenya region is also making demands for the running mate position “despite their vote not being guaranteed because of the President Kenyatta factor.”

“First there are intra-region wars in Mount Kenya pitting the Eastern side—Meru, Embu and Mbeere—against Central Kenya, with each region demanding the running-mate slot.”

Former National Assembly Majority Chief Whip and Mumias East MP Benjamin Washiali, a Ruto ally, told the Nation Wednesday that Western is keen on at least two top positions in the “coming Ruto administration”.

The DP’s de facto spokesperson—Jubilee deputy secretary-general and Soy MP Caleb Kositany — Wednesday said the DP’s camp has many options for running mate and a decision will be made towards the end of next year. He denied claims that Mr Mudavadi’s name had been discussed.

“At the moment, we can’t disclose our options but I can confirm they’re very many and they are definitely Kenyans. We will settle on the best option at the right time next year,” he said.

Former Machakos Senator Johnson Muthama said choosing a running mate is the least of the DP’s concerns.

“Once you have a presidential candidate, looking for running mate is not a problem and, furthermore, we still have two years to go. Why should we be sweating to look for a deputy now?

“What we’re trying to build now is a team that will be capable of producing leaders everywhere in this country,” the former co-chair of the Nasa steering committee said, adding, they’re confident of bagging the Mount Kenya vote.

“Central has not put a condition for them to vote for Ruto. We’re up to the task and enjoy the support of elected and non-elected leaders, while our opponents led by Uhuru Kenyatta, who is retiring, Raila Odinga, Kalonzo Musyoka and Gideon Moi even lack a clear flag bearer for 2022,” he said.

Mr Washiali said they want someone who operates above board, is transparent, accountable and has been consistently supportive of the DP’s agenda as his possible running mate.

Leaders across the country have been hesitant to openly show their support for the DP.

In the wake of the threats, most Ruto allies have chosen to keep a low profile, a fact that has put a damper on his campaigns.

Prof Manyora said this is a challenge for Ruto as “no serious leader with national support has so far shown interest in working with him as a deputy”.

Mr Muthama, however, insists that nothing stops him, “Boni Khalwale, Omar Hassan, a member of the Kuria community or even a Rendille from becoming Ruto’s running mate”.

“We know we’re winning the election and have the support of Kenyans,” he said.

"
Justus Ochieng,"Opposition leader Raila Odinga has faulted the government over the arrest of three senators opposed to the State-backed proposal on revenue sharing.

Mr Odinga said Tuesday that he did not see the need of turning the revenue sharing into a contest of might between the security organs and legislators.

“The State needs to pull back and abandon actions that take away the gains made on our path to democratisation.

""The war lords need to stop beating the drums of war or financing the divisive rhetoric and our legislators involved in this matter need to search their souls in all honesty and put public good above private gain,” Mr Odinga said.

On Monday, senators Cleophas Malala (Kakamega), Christopher Lang’at (Bomet) and Steve Lelegwe (Samburu) were arrested and ejected from Nairobi to bar them from attending a special House sitting and ensure the preferred formula is adopted. But the plan flopped after the leaders outsmarted the government side.

Following the high drama, many leaders have criticised the government’s move.

Here is Mr Odinga’s full statement:

""The events surrounding the arrest of senators yesterday, just like the acrimonious stalemate that has seen the Senate disagree a record nine times on sharing of revenue among counties stand as stark reminders that our struggle for a democratic state is far from finished.

The events have also laid bare the so far unsuccessful struggle to make integrity and search for public good over private gain the basis of our politics and holding of public offices.

The twin sins of failing integrity among a section of elected representatives during this whole affair and the instinct by agents of the State to resort to strong arm measures to get things accomplished continue to hold our country back, reducing our citizens to mere watchers in dramas whose scripts are written far from public eyes.

As we continue to push for a just, equal, democratic and prosperous Kenya, we require huge amounts of tolerance and restraint from all arms of government particularly the Executive which has at it’s a disposal disproportionate capacity for force. This will need to be matched with an equal measure of honesty and integrity from the representatives of the people where positions on public issues are guided by no considerations other than public good.

Representatives of the people lose the capacity to stand up to the State when their actions are coloured by considerations other than public good just like the State loses its capacity to be a force for good when it has to resort to draconian measures in pursuit of its ways.

It was absolutely unnecessary to turn the debate on sharing of revenue among counties into a contest between losers and gainers, pastoralists and agriculturalists, regions and tribes.

It was equally unnecessary to make revenue sharing a contest of might between the security organs and legislators.

Having pushed ourselves into deep divisions only to emerge with no formula, it’s time to tone down the ethnic and regional rhetoric and diffuse the tensions that bubbled to the surface over this matter.

The State needs to pull back and abandon actions that take away the gains made on our path to democratisation. The war lords need to stop beating the drums of war or financing the divisive rhetoric and our legislators involved in this matter need to search their souls in all honesty and put public good above private gain.

At a time that we need to come together to confront monumental problems including a struggling economy, schools whose gates are shut for children and a chronic health care crisis, we cannot afford to push positions that cause more divisions in the hope that such can boost our chances in competitive politics.

We must all desist from actions and utterances that have the potential not only to widen the ethnic divide but also denigrate our young experiment with devolution of resources and services. Now more than ever, Kenyans need to pull together, not apart. Both the politicians and the State organs need to inspire confidence rather than sow doubts in our future as one people. It begins with leaders being honest and embracing integrity in all their transactions on behalf of the people.""

"
Justus Ochieng,"When the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) was established in 2005 during the Kenyan constitutional referendum campaign, it entered the political stage when political temperatures were at fever pitch.

Initially formed by Raila Odinga and Kalonzo Musyoka's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and Kanu under Uhuru Kenyatta and William Ruto, its main goal was simple: to form a unified political vehicle to vote ""No"" against the referendum on the proposed Constitution.

The party's name is said to have been proposed by current Tourism Cabinet Secretary Najib Balala during a “No” rally in Kisumu, and has stuck ever since.

ODM went on to prove itself as a powerful force in Kenyan politics by carrying the day in the referendum, trouncing supporters of the proposed Constitution led by former President Mwai Kibaki.

However, ODM has come a long way since then. Once arguably Kenya's most popular political party, its influence has waned over the last decade.

The Odinga-led outfit has witnessed mass defections that party insiders say has impacted negatively on its quest for power.

Its achilles heel remains the party’s handling of primaries, which on many occasions are seen as mini-elections in ODM strongholds.

A past internal report found that bungled grassroot primaries, which many who vied in the past say are not free and fair, have led to mass walkouts and cost the party crucial seats, consequently weakening its power in Parliament over the years. 

Also problematic were the infamous 'men in black' who wreck havoc during intra-party polls and meetings, contributing negatively to the party’s image.

Mr Odinga confesses that the party has had its ups and downs, but contends that this is normal even among parties in developed countries.

“We have had the challenges of the men in black but those are normal challenges in any party,” Mr Odinga said at Chungwa House, the ODM headquarters in Nairobi. 

Despite the tough challenges facing ODM ahead of the 2022 General Elections, Mr Odinga is a man with a plan. 

He is keen on revamping the 15 year-old party by making changes to the party’s critical organs, particularly the National Elections Board (NEB), spelling hope for ODM party members, some of who were victims of bungled nominations.

They reckon that this, coupled with other looming changes, will boost Mr Odinga’s ambition to ascend to power as bungled primaries have always punctured his hopes by triggering voter apathy.

Former National Assembly deputy Minority leader and ex-Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo, who is also Mr Odinga’s cousin, says he was a victim of the disbanded Judith Pareno-led board, but says the changes that saw her pave way for Ms Catherine Mmuma are a step towards the right direction.

“The changes are very good but more must come along. You cannot remove Pareno and leave out Oduor Ong’wen – the party’s Executive Director. Those are birds of the same feather and for ODM to give its members confidence, it must do many more things including cleaning the Ong’wen-led secretariat,” Mr Midiwo told the Nation. 

“That must be changed because it is as rotten as the National Elections Board. The secretariat has dubiously conducted nominations and must not survive.”

ODM National Treasurer Timothy Bosire also agrees that the changes are a step the right direction.

“We want to gather all and scatter none as we put our best foot forwards towards capturing power in 2022,” he said.

Nyando MP and ODM secretary of public policy and economic affairs Jared Okello, who was part of the Prof Mmuma taskforce that put together the recommendations on what ails ODM that are now being acted upon, said the changes are aimed at restoring confidence of the party's supporters.

“ODM party has received a lot of negative publicity particularly regarding its nominations. We have been branded a party of men in black during party primaries, AGM and the biggest problem has been that there has been inadequate preparation by elections board to carry out credible nominations,” said Mr Okello.

He noted that disgruntlement over poorly conducted primaries has led to the party’s diminishing support across the country with some members defecting and going on to triumph against their candidates.

“We moved from over 100 MPs to a partly 78 in the last election. That's a harsh indictment on the part of the elections board and we hope the new team shall strive to ensure the party restores its lost glory,” said Mr Okello.

Some of the ODM members who have defected to other parties or ran as independents and won include Nyali MP Mohammed Ali (Independent), Shakeel Shabbir (Kisumu East), Peter Masara (Suna West) and Olago Aluoch (Ford Kenya) among others.

At the time, Mr Ali remarked that he left the party because he felt that the party nominations were a selection rather than an election.

Some including former Funyula MP Paul Otuoma, ex-Kisumu Governor Jack Ranguma defected to independent outfits after failing to clinch the ODM gubernatorial ticket for Busia and Kisumu respectively in 2017, leading to voter aparthy in their regions.

“The changes are meant to infuse confidence in the people as we gear towards 2022. It is a lesson to ODM supporters and their leaders and opponents that it is not business as usual,” Mr Okello said.

Uriri MP Mark Nyamita said the new NEB consists of people of good reputation, but also sees structural weaknesses undermining heir efforts.

“Sometimes it is not about officials but about the institutions. The previous NEB office did the best they could do under the circumstances...The true fact is that our political parties have no capacity now and in the near future to conduct credible nominations since our primaries are viewed as mini elections and are very rigorous,” said Mr Nyamita.

The primaries, he said, are done countrywide, for all the seats and more than one candidate hence the board has no capacity to conduct a credible exercise.

“So there will always be hue and cry. Maybe what political parties need to consider is to either work with IEBC...provide adequate funding to IEBC and have them conduct credible elections.”

“Alternatively, parties need to strengthen themselves in such a way that over a five year period they can pick whoever is going to be their candidate.”

But Kisumu East MP Mr Shabbir, who was a victim of the 2017 bungled primaries, quipped that the changes were a case of “same forest, different people.”

“It’s unfortunate that the ODM NEB could not even honour the decisions of the dispute resolution board…and the system has not changed yet just hungrier, corrupt ridden.”

Gem MP Elisha Odhiambo welcomed the changes saying he has conviction that it heralds a rebirth and re-invigoration of the party.

“The freshness in the membership signifies renewed hope and a pointer to a better future for the party,” he said.

In the new changes Ms Catherine Mumma was named chairperson of the NEB replacing nominated senator Judy Pareno who had served for a record 12 years with Abdulahi Diriye, Richard Tairo, Syntei Nchoe and Emily Awita as members.

Ms Pareno and her team consisting of Bob Arunga, Motindi Dominic, Norah Anindo and Edward Dzila was ousted.

Prof Ben Sihanya was appointed chairman of the party’s disciplinary committee to replace Lawyer Fred Athuok.

Other members of the committee include Ramadhani M. Abubakar, Mumbi Ngaru, Seth Kakusye and Dr Florence Omosa.

Following the new changes, Mr Athuok and his team consisting of Likoni MP Mishi Mboko, Halima Daro, and Harold Kipchumba now cease to hold the office.

The changes, according to ODM Secretary General Edwin Sifuna, are just some of many strategies the party will deploy as it readies for another political duel in 2022.

He said the elaborate plan to field a candidate will come to light after implementation of the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) report which is expected to be made public soon.

"
Justus Ochieng,"President Kenyatta’s legacy projects are the main drivers of the Cabinet changes he is likely to make after 11-day recess, inside sources have told the Nation.

On the political front, the President is also said to be laying ground for the receipt and execution of the BBI report.

His March 2018 ‘handshake’ partner Raila Odinga on Saturday hinted that the BBI process would resume after they receive the report from the committee Mr Yusuf Haji chairs.

Yesterday, the Nation established that Mr Kenyatta is considering seizing the opportunity during the inaugural Cabinet working recess to plan how to reorganise his government and put in place rapid measures to fast-track implementation of his Big Four agenda.

The plan unveiled in 2017 and pillared on food security, manufacturing, universal health coverage and affordable housing has been hard-hit by the Covid-19 pandemic, and Mr Kenyatta is racing against time to achieve its goals. Sources say the Head of State is likely to seize the opportunity to “put in order his administration to secure his legacy that is almost being eaten up by the pandemic.”

Some changes

“Certainly there will be some changes to fast-track the full implementation of the projects. You have also noticed the rift in the ruling Jubilee, and the Head of State must have a team that is committed to his agenda,” a senior government official said yesterday. Reorganisation of government, he said, remains inevitable and “consequently, his new friends must also be shown that their interests are taken care of for the sake of peace and unity of the country.” State House Spokesperson Kanze Dena-Mararo, however, said the Cabinet recess is a normal undertaking.

“It is a working recess. It is normal for Cabinet to go on working recess three times in a year – April, August and December,” she told the Nation.

This, Ms Mararo said, happens across the Commonwealth.

Her sentiments were later echoed by the Head of Public Service Joseph Kinyua who, in a statement, said: “The Cabinet calendar is in tandem with the practice within the Commonwealth and heralds a new tradition in the management of Cabinet business.”

Jubilee Secretary-General Raphael Tuju in a recent exclusive interview with the Nation said President Kenyatta is working on a governance structure that is accommodative of all Kenyans as the country heads towards the 2022 elections in a bid to cement his legacy.

Weak link

With the knowledge of hindsight on how the country’s politics has been a weak link and a recipe for chaos every electioneering cycle, the President’s party – Jubilee—has been reaching out to the opposition to craft a unitary system that accommodates everyone.

“The political process in our country is in transition and requires a lot of State craft skills to be able to deal with ethnic interests, regional interests and be able to accommodate even those who are supposedly members of the opposition,” Mr Tuju said.

On Sunday, Senate Majority Chief Whip Irungu Kang’ata defended the President’s move to send the Cabinet on recess, saying it will boost productivity.

The President’s move however, mirrors one by his predecessor Mwai Kibaki’s in 2005 when he dissolved the entire Cabinet following government’s loss in the 2005 constitutional referendum.

In that year, Mr Odinga and his troops were dropped from the Cabinet. In June, Mr Kang’ata confirmed to the Nation the “impending cabinet reshuffle.”

“Yes, indeed there will be a cabinet reshuffle. CSs and PSs who do not add any value to the government will be axed,” Mr Kang’ata said.

"
Justus Ochieng,"The Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) has raised the red flag about “con men” posing as party consultants in a bid to shape the looming Msambweni mini-poll.

Secretary-General Edwin Sifuna on Monday said the party led by Mr Raila Odinga had received reports of people conducting research on its behalf on candidates’ suitability.

“We wish to make it clear that the party has not dispatched any one on such an assignment or any other assignment in the constituency,” Mr Sifuna said in a statement.

“Any person claiming otherwise should be treated as a con and reported to the nearest police station.”

He urged ODM’s supporters and the people of Msambweni to remain patient as the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) plans the vote.

“We call on our supporters to remain patient as IEBC develops protocols for the conduct of the by-election and assure them that when the time comes, they shall be fully involved in the choice of the party's flag bearer.”

The Msambweni seat fell vacant after MP Suleiman Dori died of cancer at the Aga Khan Hospital in Mombasa on March 9, 2020.

In April, the IEBC announced that it had postponed the mini-poll due to the coronavirus outbreak.

IEBC chair Wafula Chebukati said they were ready at the time but the Covid-19 pandemic posed unprecedented challenges.

“The day to day operations of the commission have been disrupted and the conduct of the upcoming by-elections will be adversely affected,” he said.

Last Week, Mr Chebukati told the Nation that the commission was finalising protocols for conducting its activities amid the fight against the virus to enable it execute its constitutional mandate.

"
Justus Ochieng,"ODM leader Raila Odinga is caught up in a political dilemma over whether to fully be part of the Jubilee government or continue with his role as the de facto opposition chief.

Mr Odinga has been working with the Jubilee administration courtesy of his March 9, 2018 ‘handshake’ deal with President Uhuru Kenyatta.

This has seen his ODM party benefit from various National Assembly and Senate parliamentary committee roles. The sacking of deputy president William Ruto’s allies from parliamentary committees and their subsequent replacement with Mr Odinga’s men explains how deep rooted the ODM leader’s influence in government has become.

Matters have been complicated by the split in ODM over the Division of Revenue Bill supported by the government but opposed by senators from Mr Odinga’s party.

Mr Odinga is, however, reluctant to lead his brigade out of the opposition coalition National Super Alliance (Nasa) as this would automatically mean relinquishing his opposition role.

“Even those in majority party are playing their role and to say ODM is not doing its role, what about Jubilee? They also have a role to oversight that government.”

He said ODM is both in opposition and in government only in the sense that “it controls 16 county governments and runs more than 16  county assemblies.”

Mr Mbadi, the ODM national chairman, however, argues that their working with the government should not be misconstrued to mean defection.

“We are working with the government courtesy of the handshake and this has brought together all the parties. Those against handshake are merely rebels and do not constitute a political party to purport that they can now perform opposition role,” Mr Mbadi told Sunday Nation.

He added, “Let the Tangatanga team accept that the politics of the day has changed. They must know that ODM and other parties can now agree with a section of Jubilee and allow them to even share certain committees in Parliament. They should not misinterpret this to mean we have defected to government,” said Mr Mbadi.

But Jubilee deputy secretary-general Caleb Kositany, a DP Ruto’s ally, insists that ODM cannot purport to continue performing the role of opposition while “flirting with the government”.

“They should relinquish the role of opposition especially the chairmanship of Public Accounts Committee (PAC) and Public Investment Committee (PIC) and go and take other government positions,” Mr Kositany says.

Ugunja MP Opiyo Wandayi (ODM) and his Mvita counterpart Abdulswamad Nassir (ODM) chair PAC and PIC committees respectively.

This direction would have far reaching consequences as he would lose key parliamentary positions held by his ODM troops.

ODM being the minority party in the National Assembly and the Senate holds key positions among them minority leader held by Suba South MP John Mbadi and Siaya Senator James Orengo respectively.

Suna East MP Junet Mohammed, an ODM member, also holds the National Assembly minority chief whip position.

The party also holds key committee positions courtesy of being the official opposition.

There is clear separation of powers. Mr Odinga, however, argues that the Executive, Legislature and Judiciary have well-spelt-out roles in the country’s system.

“In a presidential system, parliament as an institution is supposed to oversight the executive. It is not only the responsibility of minority party to oversight, even the majority party is part and parcel of the process of over-sighting,” Mr Odinga said Thursday.

He said the media “must stop claims that opposition is weak as MPs play their role of oversight”.


“ODM needs to make a decision. Either they are in government or in opposition. As it is now, going by the body language, they have made a decision to be in government,” insists Mr Kositany.

Generally, the Soy MP argued, there is a confused atmosphere in the political situation of the country and Mr Odinga owes Kenyans an explanation.

Political analyst Javas Bigambo however, argued that Mr Odinga’s working relationship with President Kenyatta’s government has not eroded democracy.

“It has, however, suffocated the power of opposition oversight of government, and killed the watchdog role of the opposition,” said Mr Bigambo.

Mr Odinga, the analyst argued, has a strong support base that agrees with his working strategy with “Uhuru...and democracy is about the people's will.”

“The most regrettable thing is that oversight affairs in Parliament as well as effect of checks and balances have been totally watered down,” Mr Bigambo said.

Mr Kositany also insisted that minority cannot join the majority as that will leave no party offering checks and balances to the government.

Belgut MP Nelson Koech said everything bad is happening in the country including violation of the constitution “because we have no vibrant opposition.”

He accused Mr Odinga of being involved in an arrangement that is “unheard of in any democratic country across the world where an opposition goes to bed with Government.”

“In fact, he is undoing the democratic gains he helped achieve in the early days. Raila's better days are behind him and he has realised that since he cannot beat them he joins them,” Mr Koech said.

But ODM National treasurer Mr Timothy Bosire said some people were mistakenly getting the meaning of Mr Odinga and President Kenyatta’s working relationship different from what is intended.

“The issues we are trying to address as per the handshake deal requires that the two principals work closely together including their foot soldiers.”

"
Justus Ochieng,"Orange Democratic Movement leader Raila Odinga on Thursday told the electoral agency to prepare for a referendum.

Mr Odinga said the “unstoppable” plebiscite would be held as soon as he and President Uhuru Kenyatta receive the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) report.

Some politicians, especially those drawn from Deputy President William Ruto’s Tangatanga wing of the ruling Jubilee Party, want the vote held alongside the 2022 General Election “to cut costs”.

Mr Odinga said the time “is now and BBI will start walking again”.

“They said reggae stopped. It did not stop. It only went for half time. Players have been getting massage and instructions from coaches,” he said at Chungwa House during the swearing-in of newly appointed officials to the party elections board and disciplinary committee.

“We have been doing some overhaul and reggae will be back shortly.”

He asked Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) chairman Wafula Chebukati to prepare for the vote.

“There is money and we can teach Chebukati how to do it. We are going to show them how to do it,” Mr Odinga said.

The plebiscite, he added, must be conducted before the 2022   elections “because voters should not be confused with many ballot papers”.

“When there are six ballots and you want to add another one to illiterate voters, it will not work,” he said.

Contacted later, Mr Chebukati said a referendum can be held any time provided the process complies with constitutional provisions, the referendum law and other regulations.

“The commission is ready to execute this constitutional mandate upon receipt of ample notice and a budgetary allocation for the activities,” the IEBC chief said.

He added that the commission is putting in place guidelines for its activities amid the Covid-19 pandemic.

Mr Odinga said Kenyan elections have been costly “because of corruption”, adding that it is possible to spend Sh2 billion on a plebiscite.

“Some people say there is no money for a referendum. That it is very expensive. Others say billions of shillings have been spent on BBI. This is wrong. We do not need to use billions in a referendum. The money issue should not arise,” he said.

Mr Odinga said BBI would ensure no blood is shed because of elections.

Belgut MP Nelson Koech accused Mr Odinga of insensitivity and arrogance.

“That is a selfish lot of politicians. We say it is impossible after analysing the impracticality of the referendum,” Mr Koech said.

“Raila says Sh40 billion is exaggerated. Even if the budget is reduced to a quarter of that, the sum is still huge. There is no proper IEBC in place, coronavirus numbers are rising sharply and the environment is not conducive to queue and vote, leave alone popularising the contents. Kenyans have lost jobs. Where does he get the guts to say that?”

He added that Mr Odinga and his followers are running out of time “to regularise their selfish ambitions through amendments to the Constitution”.

“That should not give them a licence to bulldoze their ambitions,” he said.

"
Justus Ochieng,"ODM leader Raila Odinga has waded into the debate on the ‘deep state’, following claims by Deputy President William Ruto that he is ready to face it in the 2022 elections.

On Tuesday, the DP dared the “system” to face him, saying, he has “God and a majority of Kenyans” to back what he said was an unstoppable presidential campaign.

“I just want to tell them: ‘We’re waiting for you’. This system, this deep state we are being told about, we are waiting for it,” the DP said.

But speaking when he witnessed the swearing in of newly appointed officials of ODM's National Elections Board (NEB) and the Disciplinary Committee at the party’s headquarters on Thursday, Mr Odinga said the presidency, which Mr Ruto is part of, remains the centre of power in the country.

“We have a president whose name you know, and a deputy whose name you also know. So when you are talking about deep state, then who is there? It is the president and his deputy,” Mr Odinga said.

“So go and ask the deputy president which deep state he is talking about.”

ODM, he said, is not in government and “we don’t know who deep state is"".

He said the agenda of the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) should not be misconstrued, adding that its purpose is to ensure Kenyans have free and fair elections.

“BBI is meant to ensure no Kenyan’s blood is shed because of an election,” he said.

The oath taking ceremony ODM NEB and Disciplinary Committee officials was held at Chungwa House and was presided over by Ms Jane Nyaboke, an advocate of the High court.

Those who took oath of office included NEB Chairperson Catherine Mumma who replaces nominated senator Judith Pareno and members Abdulahi Diriye, Richard Tairo, Syntei Nchoe and Emily Awita.

Prof Ben Sihanya was sworn in as the new chairman of the disciplinary committee, replacing Mr Fred Athuok.

Other members of the committee who also took oath of office are Ramadhani M. Abubakar, Mumbi Ng’aru, Seth Kakusye and Dr Florence Omosa.

Mr Odinga said the party will now focus on holding elections, adding that all members must uphold discipline and peace.

“We want to ensure we internalise democracy within our party. You cannot expect to run a democratic government if you don’t have democracy within the party itself,” he said.

ODM Secretary-General Edwin Sifuna said the outgoing officials had not been kicked out but had completed their five-year terms.

Ms Pareno, he said, had served the NEB for a record 12 years since May 8, 2008.

Mr Sifuna said Mr Odinga remains the undisputed “captain, super striker and top scorer” in politics.

ODM Director of Elections Junet Mohammed challenged the team to ensure only popular candidates are fronted so as to give them easy time for campaigns.

The party’s Chairman John Mbadi told Ms Mmuma to ensure she implements the recommendations by her taskforce on how to strengthen the Orange party.

Justus Ochieng,"Jubilee Party has summoned at least eight MCAs to appear before its disciplinary committee on Thursday over misconduct, hours after Speaker Beatrice Elachi,’s resignation.

Those summoned include Deputy Speaker John Kamangu Nyumu (Ruai) who is being touted as the acting Speaker following Ms Elachi’s exit.

The others are Millicent Mugambi (Ziwani), Jeremiah Karani (Kayole Central), George Thuo Wakarindi (Dandora Phase 3) and nominated MCAs June Ndegwa, Joyce Kamau, Susan Makungu and Margaret Mbote.

In the summonses signed by party chair Nelson Dzuya and copied to Secretary-General Raphael Tuju, the MCAs are accused of “various infractions in their conduct that contravene the standards of discipline as per the party constitution”.

“This letter is to inform you that you are required to appear before the disciplinary committee on August 13, 2020 at 10 am at the party headquarters,” the letter states, adding those summoned acted contrary to pledges made and signed for in 2017.

“The committee shall grant you an audience on this date to hear your side of the story. A decision may then be made whether to prefer formal charges or not against you.”

A fortnight ago, chaos rocked City Hall after a section of MCAs stormed the premises to collect signatures for use in kicking out Ms Elachi, who resigned Tuesday.

The MCAs, believed to be allied to Governor Mike Sonko, accused Ms Elachi of instigating the division between the governor and the Nairobi Metropolitan Services, headed by Maj Gen Mohamed Badi.

Police officers were forced to step in to disperse the chaotic lawmakers.

They had collected at least 60 signatures then, out of the minimum threshold of 42 needed to file an impeachment notice against the Speaker.

Sam Kiplagat,"A senior official at a public roads agency has been found with assets in excess of Sh1.5 billion despite him earning a relative modest monthly salary of Sh390,000, triggering investigations into the source of his wealth.

Benson Muteti Musila, a regional manager of the Kenya Rural Roads Authority (Kerra), is required to explain how he acquired his vast wealth of 35 assets, including land and other real estate property in Nairobi, Makueni and Kilifi counties which are managed by his spouse, Zipporah Mwongeli.

The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) raised the red flag on Mr Musila’s wealth on suspicion that he was a beneficiary of kickbacks from road contractors through an account at KCB Bank Kilifi branch.

He, however, denied the claims and rushed to court seeking to block the EACC from investigating the wealth he co-owned with his wife, alleging a violation of his rights.

Anti-Corruption Court judge Mumbi Ngugi on Wednesday dismissed Mr Musila’s petition and allowed the EACC to investigate the source of his wealth.

“What the petitioners seek is to stop not only the investigations but, in the event that the EACC finds any evidence requiring the prosecution of the 1st petitioner (Mr Muteti), to pre-empt such prosecution by the DPP (Director of Public Prosecutions),” the judge said.

Justice Ngugi said it was in the public interest that the investigative bodies are allowed to carry out their mandates without interference, adding that there must be very clear and cogent reasons for the court to interfere with the exercise of their powers.

The judge added that Mr Musila failed to demonstrate a violation of his rights by the EACC’s investigators.

Following the nod by the court, the EACC is now set to resume investigating Mr Musila who is in-charge of Kerra’s operations in Kilifi and Mombasa.

When the EACC first raided Mr Musila’s home and office in Kilifi in 2018, they reportedly carted away a total of Sh2.06 million in cash.

The amount, he claimed, included Sh183,000 in personal money while the rest was from his employer for repairs of Baricho bridge in Kilifi.

A simultaneous raid at the suspect’s home in Nairobi’s Imara Daima estate reportedly netted Sh685,000 in cash from his wife. Part of the amount was found stashed in the wife’s handbag. She is said to have claimed the part of the confiscated amount was fees collected from three schools she had established in Makindu between July 2005 and May 2015.

Ms Mwongeli, a trained teacher, alleged that apart from running the schools, she operates a bakery, practises dairy farming as well as other businesses such as supply of school uniforms.

She further said she runs rental units known as Mumbe Villas and Mumbe Plaza, which earn her Sh300,000 and Sh350,000 monthly respectively.

According to filings in court, the couple also runs a hardware store in Makindu, Makueni and Ruaraka in Nairobi, while their son, runs a construction firm known as Mumbe Construction.

Mumbe Construction is also at the heart of investigations by the EACC, which claims the firm unduly benefited from contracts in Kilifi and Mombasa counties, an assertion Mr Musila denied.

The EACC said multiple deposits had been made into Mr Musila’s KCB account. The anti-graft agency suspects the deposits were from contractors either seeking favours or paying back for jobs already awarded.

Mr Musila, however, maintained that the funds in the KCB account were meant to pay staff and finance general office administration.

He said that being the regional manager, his salary coupled with supervisory allowances of not less than Sh750,000 a month meant that he would take home about Sh1.14 million, much of which he invested in business.

The EACC said Mr Musila’s claims of earning Sh750,000 in monthly allowances could be false since it did not reflect in his returns filed with the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA).

The anti-graft body said that it had already issued him with a notice requiring him to explain in writing the discrepancy between his net asserts and a cumulative income amounting to Sh648 million.

According to Mr Musila, his assets are worth about Sh100 million and not Sh1.5 billion as alleged by the EACC.

Mr Musila previously worked for Ministry of Public Works after graduating from the University of Nairobi in 1993. He had also worked as the roads engineer Bungoma, and a district works officer and regional manager Makueni.

"
Sam Kiplagat,"The Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) has won a tax battle with Rift Valley Railways (RVR) after a tribunal ordered the consortium to pay Sh1.6 billion.

The Tax Appeals Tribunal chaired by Mr Mahat Somane dismissed the petition by the concessionaire stating that some of the items imported by RVR, among them locomotives and diesel engines, were not tax exempt as alleged.

“This therefore leaves room for one reasonable conclusion; that the appellant (RVR) was not granted remission in respect of the locomotives and as such the taxes as assessed by the respondent (KRA) are properly due and payable by the appellant,” the Tribunal ruled.

KRA told the tribunal that it did an analysis of the company’s business between 2011 and 2016 in respect of customs duty, value added tax, withholding tax and withholding VAT. The taxman later in 2017 issued an assessment notice for taxes amounting to Sh1.69 billion.

The company, however disputed the claim saying it had obtained VAT remission from Ministry of Finance for some of the items it imported including train simulator system, tamping and ballast distributing machines, knock down kits and diesel engines.

Further, RVR said part of the tax demanded were transit material for goods destined for Uganda and KRA had misapplied the law by seeking to standard rate the revenue attributed to transportation of goods in transit.

But KRA argued that the company undervalued freight charges on six imported locomotives in December 2014.

The taxman further accused RVR of fraudulent remission of VAT on importation of tamping and ballast distributing machines, claiming it had obtained remission from the Ministry of Finance.

The tribunal ruled that the failure to withhold tax as required was a breach of the law on the part of the RVR, a move that was occasioned by its miscomprehension of the effects of the repeal of Section 25A of the VAT Act.

According to the tribunal, a perusal of the documents showed that some items the company claimed were exempted had been left out by the Treasury in a letter dated August 15, 2011.

“Accordingly, we find that the taxes assessed by the respondent in respect of the locomotive, spare parts, diesel engines, train simulator and the tamping machine are owing to the public purse and should be settled by the appellant,” the tribunal ruled.

The company, however got a reprieve after the tribunal quashed tax debt of Sh56.7 million after providing documents to support payment.

“The appellant’s withholding tax liability in respect of local and imported services should be reduced by Sh56,717,291 for which it has correctly supported,” the tribunal ruled.

"
Sam Kiplagat,"Stima Sacco has lost a court battle against Maseno University Savings and Credit Society over a failed deal to purchase shares in Co-operative Bank of Kenya  worth Sh108 million.

Justice Grace Nzioka directed Stima Sacco to conclude purchase of the nine million Co-operative Bank of Kenya shares from Maseno Sacco within 30 days.

Stima Sacco was accused on reneging on a 2016 deal to buy the Sh108 million stock from Maseno Sacco, which needed to sell the stock to boost its cash flow and loan disbursement to its members.

But Maseno could not sell the shares because it had used them as security for a Sh45 million loan from Stima Sacco.

Thejudge also directed Stima Sacco to deduct the Sh45 million loan, which Maseno Sacco was struggling to repay.

Also to be deducted from the amount is Sh5.8 million Stima Sacco had paid for the transfer of the shares from Co-op Holding & Company Limited, a coalition of Saccos that owns 64.56 percent of Cooperative Bank.

“Similarly, it suffices to note that, the Respondent (Stima) had even paid the relevant taxes to facilitate the transfer. They had signed the payment voucher; they had willed their rights to dividends to the Appellant (Maseno),” the judge said.

“All these acts amount to part performance of the contract by the Respondent. It is only appropriate that they should complete the transaction,” the judge said.

The court heard that the two Saccos entered into a deal in January 2016 in which Maseno would sell some 9 million shares to Stima at Sh12 per share. The class ‘A’ shares are traded among cooperative societies.

The transaction was approved by the authorised officers of the respective parties and subsequently, Stima was notified by Co-op that the documentation process was complete for it to pay transfer fees and applicable taxes. However, Maseno said Stima failed to pay for the purchase of the shares exposing it to financial problems, which led to mass exodus of its membership.

The matter was referred before the Cooperatives tribunal, which on conclusion ordered Stima Sacco to pay Maseno Sh2.5 million for general damages for breach of contract.

"
Sam Kiplagat,"The Court of Appeal on Monday declined to suspend a decision allowing the government to seize Sh282 million in bank accounts and a Runda house belonging to former City Hall chief finance officer Jimmy Kiamba and his wife.

A bench of three judges instead directed the appeal by Mr Kiamba and Tracy Mbinya to be heard without delay, granting the State the right to seize the assets.

Mr Kiamba had petitioned the judges to freeze the confiscation of his banks accounts and a property in Runda worth Sh35 million, pending the outcome of an appeal, where he protested the probe of his financial dealings without his knowledge.

The former finance chief was accused of amassing a total of Sh1.3 billion in about five years he was at City Hall.

He deposited more than Sh400 million between January and November 2014 despite earning a monthly salary of Sh85,000.

EACC said Mr Kiamba deposited large sums of money in several accounts held at CfC Stanbic Bank (Sh719 million), Standard Chartered Bank (Sh312 million), Equity Bank (Sh286 million), Co-operative Bank (Sh32.1 million) and Gulf Africa (Sh39.1million).

Mr Kiamba on average deposited Sh23.6 million monthly through proxies including City Hall accountants, security staff, clerks and his official driver between August 2009 and February 2015, according to court documents.

In the ruling the judges of appeal said the case involves allegations of corruption and theft of public resources which are matters of great public importance and interest.

“Furthermore, we are satisfied that this court is capable of determining the issues of interpretation and application of the Constitution raised in the appeal and that, as the respondents rightly points out, by dint of Article 8 163(4) of the Constitution, any aggrieved party has a right of appeal to the Supreme Court,” Justices Martha Koome, Kathurima M’Inoti and Sankale ole Kantai ruled.

Mr Kiamba wanted the decision suspended arguing that a case pending before the Supreme Court was likely to affect the outcome of his appeal because just like the case pending before the top court, the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) failed to notify him before investigating his eleven bank accounts.

He said the Court of Appeal ruled last year that EACC was required by sections 26, 27, and 28 of the Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Act to notify any suspect, which it failed to do.

The anti-graft body and the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) later filed an appeal and the Supreme Court suspended the decision, pending determination of the petition.

His lawyer, Senior Counsel Tom Ojienda, had argued that the case should be suspended awaiting the outcome of the Supreme Court’s determination.

But EACC, through Philip Kaguchia, said the matter pending before the Supreme Court was distinct from Mr Kiamba’s case.

The money and assets which were to be taken over by the government include revenue Mr Kiamba claimed he got from sale of cattle amounting to Sh21,971,810, another Sh17,094,610, he claimed were from sale of wheat, Sh12,478,430 he said were from sale of maize and Sh228,103,754, he said were from transport and quarry services he runs.

Mr Kiamba, however, had satisfactorily explained how he had obtained some of the properties, among them a house along Naivasha Avenue and another home in Muthaiga.

Sam Kiplagat,"Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji has opposed the release on bond of a Kenyan wanted in the United States of America for drug-related charges.

Making the application before a Nairobi court, the DPP said there are high chances for Mansur Mohamed Surur alisas Mansour to escape if released on bail.

The court heard that the US government issued a warrant for the arrest of Mr Surur following his indictment by a New York court for conspiracy to commit wildlife trafficking, money laundering and conspiracy to distribute and possess narcotic drugs.

Mr Surur was arrested on July 29 at the Moi International Airport, Mombasa after landing from Yemen in a chartered flight.

Senior Assistant DPP Catherine Mwaniki told the court that the police were investigating how he left the country despite the alert being issued by Interpol. He allegedly left the country through South Sudan and subsequently to Yemen.

Further, the DPP said he has received an extradition request from USA and at the same time seeking the arrest and surrender of Mr Badru Abdul Aziz, his co-conspirator.

The court heard that Mr Aziz was arrested in June 2019 but was released on bond only for him to vanish. And just like his accomplice, the DPP said, Mr Surur might disappear.

"
Sam Kiplagat,"A transport and construction company has failed to convince a judge to compel NCBA  to pay it for damages allegedly suffered for listing the firm as a loan defaulter.

Pekatewa Investments company Ltd sued the lender accusing it of writing to its directors and copying Credit Reference Bureau (CRB) in June 2013, falsely and maliciously alleging that the company’s loan account was in arrears for over 90 days.

The firm’s managing director Peterson Kamau Kiarie testified that he later received an apology from the bank for the erroneous listing but claimed that it was an afterthought.

He demanded a public apology insisting that the listing was circulated to its other bankers, among them Kenya Commercial Bank, which declined to advance his company a loan.

But Justice Cecelia Githua said although the company claimed that the publication of the letter caused damage to its business reputation, it failed to adduce any evidence to substantiate or to prove this claim.

“He (Mr Kiarie) did not however produce any documentary evidence to that effect and he did not claim that the plaintiff suffered any loss or damage as a result of the publication,” the Judge said.

The bank defended itself saying the erroneous listing was caused by systemic errors generated in the course of transitioning from the old to a new core banking system

The lender said the move was not deliberate or malicious and that the error was swiftly corrected and an apology made to the firm. NCBA also said it wrote the letter in good faith in compliance with its statutory duties under the Banking Act and the Banking Regulations.

The judge said the company totally failed to discharge its burden of proving on a balance of probabilities that the lender caused its listing with the CRBs maliciously.

"
Sam Kiplagat,"The High Court Thursday ordered the seizure of two vehicles belonging to drugs trafficking suspect Joyce Teresia Akinyi Ochieng.

Justice Mumbi Ngugi ordered Ms Akinyi, who shot to fame over a fight for property with Nigerian Anthony Chinedu, to surrender the two vehicles and their logbooks to the DCI headquarters on Kiambu Road.

In the petition certified as urgent, Assets Recovery Agency also tabled activities in her two bank accounts between 2015 and 2018, pointing to alleged illegal activities.

The documents show that she opened the accounts at Stanbic Bank in 2015 and in November 10, 2015, deposited Sh20 million in one of the accounts and withdrew Sh7.7 million within 10 days. There were subsequent deposits totalling to about Sh20.7 million.

In the second account, the agency said Ms Akinyi deposited about Sh50 million between January 7, 2015 and September 21, 2018.

A huge deposit of Sh37.7 million was made on October 28 2015 and she withdrew part of the money including Sh20 million on November 10, 2015.

“That my investigations established that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the assets in issue are proceeds of crime through illegitimate trade in narcotic drug substance conducted by the respondent and has not given reasonable explanation to prove any legitimate source of income,” Mr Fredrick Muriuki, an investigator said.

In the application, ARA pleaded with the court to order the preservation of the vehicles, arguing that there are reasons to believe they are proceeds of crime.

This was after Ms Akinyi was arrested on July 13, last year together with two other suspects at her Deep West Resort in Nairobi West. They were subsequently charged with dealing in narcotic drugs before a court at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport when she was found with 1,050 grammes of heroin, with a street value of Sh3.09 million.

The vehicles are two Toyotas- a KCR 521Z and KCG 856G bought in October 2016 and January 2018, respectively.

The court ordered the Director General of the National Transport and Safety Authority to place a caveat against the records of the two motor vehicles.

Sam Kiplagat,"Growing up in Kamaregwa village in Embu County Lincoln Kivuti Njeru’s star looked bright, at least going by an exemplary academic performance right from his childhood days in the early 1970s when being well read would earn one some of the best job opportunities unlike today.

Njeru’s academic prowess showed early when he sat the preparatory Certificate of Primary Education (CPE) exams at Kiangima Primary School in 1976, bagging 32 out of the possible 36 points, earning him an admission to Kangaru High School where he again shone in the Kenya Certificate Examination (KCE), attaining a high score of Division 1 of 19 points.

He would then proceed to the University of Nairobi where he earned Bachelor of Science degree in mathematics — a feat that opened doors to a memorable career, starting off as a trainee at global consultancy firm, KPMG Pitmarwick in 1987 and later joining the Kenya National Assurance in the same capacity before rising through the rank of executive assistant.

Njeru’s highest career point came in 2006 when he held the rank of Assistant General Manager at the Insurance Company of East Africa (ICEA). But as fate would have it, the stint at ICEA came with bad decisions that the 58-year-old will regret for the rest of his life.

Perhaps swayed by the fancies of life on the fast lane, Njeru who now faces three years in jail, dipped his hands into his employers’ cookie jar and illegally fished out Sh62.7million when he served as the investment manager.

Evidence presented in court showed that he received the money through collapsed Nyaga stockbrokers for sale of ICEA share investments.

But instead of wiring the funds to the insurance firm’s accounts, he deposited it to his personal accounts. He also invested some at the Nairobi Securities Exchange, but claimed that he would have refunded the money only that the share value at the Nairobi bourse got eroded.

Mr Njeru pleaded with Nairobi Chief Magistrate Francis Andayi that he was sick and had mended his ways. But the magistrate would hear none of it and dismissed his request to be handed a non-custodial sentence.

The court heard that he withdrew the money from HFCK, Barclays Bank (now Absa) and Nyaga Stockbrokers but the amounts ended up in his accounts. Evidence showed that the money was deposited into the accounts of ICEA at the HFCK, then transferred to Barclays and later to the brokerage firm allegedly for investment in stocks.

The father of three blamed his employer for pursuing criminal and civil cases against him in a bid to recover the money. To get back his footing, the accountant took a loan from Equity Bank in 2008 to engage in commercial farming but there returns were very poor, sinking him into more debts.

He developed stomach ulcers and high blood pressure, he said. “I have been on medication,” he said blaming the employer for the multiple suits.

Mr Njeru was charged with three counts, among them stealing Sh15.6 million between January 17, 2003 and September 2, 2003 from ICEA when he was employed as an assistant general manager.

Evidence showed that some Sh10 million was recovered from him and a further Sh7 million was found in his account. He said he could have refunded the money if he were financially stable.

Unexplained millions

The church elder also blamed some people he did not name, for taking advantage of him to diverge the funds.

The court found that the money deposited in the accounts of ICEA were withdrawn and deposited into his personal account.

""From the totality of evidence presented by the prosecution the losses experienced by ICEA were correctly linked to the accused person and not as investment losses as he purported,"" the magistrate stated in his sentence.

The magistrate said the accused could not explain the source of the millions of shillings he held in his bank accounts.

Mr Andayi also rejected the probation report where Mr Njeru admitted the theft, offered to seek forgiveness from the ICEA Insurance executive team and asked for a non-custodial sentence on the grounds of ill-health.

The pleas by the 58-year-old to be pardoned fell on deaf years. He blamed the bad choices he made on his young and ambitious life. He even admitted that he was greedy and should not have touched the money channelled to him by virtue of his employment.

"
Sam Kiplagat,"Jubilee secretary-general Raphael Tuju has petitioned the Judicial Service Commission (JSC) to sack a judge presiding over a case involving his company and regional lender East African Development Bank (EADB).

In a petition before the JSC, Mr Tuju accuses High Court judge Mary Kasango of siding with EADB in her handling of the dispute over a Sh1.6 billion debt.

Mr Tuju’s firm, Dari Ltd, was placed under receivership in January over debt owed to EADB, although the politician has appealed the decision.

“Throughout the proceedings in this matter, the judge has exhibited favouritism towards EADB and bias against Dari Ltd and its directors. This is evidence from the judge’s failure to act judiciously in matters that prejudice Dari Ltd and its directors,"" Mr Tuju says.

Mr Tuju’s lawyers Paul Muite and Paul Nyamodi Monday urged Justice Kasango to recuse herself from hearing contempt proceedings brought against their client, citing the petition seeking her removal.

The JSC petition says that the hurried manner in which the judge has proceeded to hear an application seeking to find Mr Tuju and his children in contempt of court is indicative of bias against Dari and its directors.

Mr Tuju argues that the judge is determined to find the directors in contempt of court on allegations they blocked EADB from taking control of a family property over the Sh1.6 billion debt.

The judge, he says, granted receivers access to his company and heard contempt of court proceedings without granting him and his children an opportunity to be heard.

The politician claims the judge also doubted whether he would comply with a directive of the Court of Appeal requiring Dari to deposit Sh50 million in court as a condition for stopping the bank from auctioning his property.

""The judge seems to have somehow acquired a personal stake in the matter and determined to ensure that we do not have our day in court,"" he says.

EADB wanted the court to proceed with an application seeking to have Mr Tuju, his children Yma, Alma and Mano punished for disobeying a court order.

""It is a clear intimidation and a motive to destroy the judicial system of this country,"" EADB said through senior counsel Fred Ojiambo in reference to the JSC petition.

EADB is demanding Sh1.6 billion from Tuju following a botched loan deal that saw the regional lender offer Dari a $9.3 million (Sh943.9million)

The loans were for the construction of Sh100 million two-storey, flat-roofed bungalows sitting on a 20-acre forested land dubbed Entim Sidai and purchase of a 94-year-old bungalow built by a Scottish missionary, Dr Albert Patterson, which currently operates as a high-end restaurant.

But the development of the 12 luxury homes worth Sh1.2 billion has fallen behind schedule, setting the stage for defaults and asset seizures.

Mr Tuju blamed EADB for the delayed construction of the homes after the lender declined to provide additional money for building the luxury houses in breach of the loan agreement.

Mr Tuju accused EADB of disbursing Sh932.7million instead of the agreed Sh943.9 million, adding that the bank had reneged on the plan to offer Sh294 million for building the luxury homes for sale.

Sam Kiplagat,"A businesswoman facing charges of dealing in narcotic drugs Monday lost six vehicles, among them five minibuses, after the High Court ruled that they were proceeds of crime.

Rose Monyani Musanda also lost a total of Sh1.78 million which were held in two banks. Although two vehicles had been registered in the names of Thomas Odhiambo Konduti and Margaret Wambui Mugo, Justice Mumbi Ngugi ruled that all the vehicles belonged to Ms Musanda and the two were just her proxies to conceal her illegal business.

The judge dismissed the sale agreements and purported transfers to Mr Odhiambo and Ms Wambui saying it was an attempt to conceal their ownership.

“Taking all the facts placed before me in this matter, I am satisfied that the applicant (Assets Recovery Agency) has established on a balance of probabilities, that the assets and funds subject of the application do not have a lawful basis,” the judge said.

Evidence presented in court showed that the three made deposits of between Sh13,000 and Sh43,000 daily with ARA arguing that the proceeds were from drug business, mixed with the legitimate daily proceeds from the matatus.

ARA through Mohammed Adow said Ms Musanda constantly changing her businesses an indication of her effort and intentions to conceal the benefits of illegal trade. And despite claiming to be a matatu owner and dealer in second hand clothing, they filed nil or failed to file their tax returns.

Ms Mugo said her bus was engaged in public transport business and not money laundering or drug business as alleged. The bus, she said was registered under Latema Travellers Sacco.

Ms Musanda said the 33-seater matatus were acquired from loans at Sidian and Equity banks and had no connection with alleged illegal trade in narcotic drugs.

She together with her daughter and son in-law were charged before a court in Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) with trading in narcotic drugs.

Mr Adow told the court that there is a thread of evidence showing that she was trading in narcotic drugs and suspicious deposits were made into the accounts and she subsequently acquired the vehicles.

But the woman said she bought her first vehicle after selling a plot in Kakamega and inheriting Sh500,000 from her late husband.

Mr Adow, however said her accounts statements established massive cash deposits to her accounts in tranches of below Sh1 million to evade the reporting threshold as per Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) prudential guidelines.

During the arrest, a search was conducted at her residence and total of 796.66 grams of heroin were recovered from her Kinoo house. Also found were cannabis sativa (bhang).

“However, despite being the owner of at least six bus coaches and a vendor of a second hand clothes, she has not placed before the court any documents that can establish the earnings from her businesses,” the Judge said.

"
Sam Kiplagat,"President Uhuru Kenyatta has been put in the spotlight after the Supreme Court recommended the dissolution of the National Assembly for non-compliance with the two-thirds gender rule, a move likely to test his commitment to the rule of law.

The advisory by Chief Justice David Maraga followed six petitions by the Law Society of Kenya(LSK), former Marakwet West MP David Sudi and Law Society of Kenya (LSK) Margaret Toili, Fredrick Mbugua, Bernhard Aoko and Stephen Owoko, urging him to advise the Head of State to dissolve Parliament for failing to pass the affirmative action legislation in accordance with the Constitution.

The CJ pointed out that Article 261 (1), read together with the Fifth Schedule, provides that the enactment of the two-thirds gender principle was among the things Parliament was to do within five years after the promulgation of the Constitution in 2010. This has not happened 10 years later.

“There is no doubt the dissolution of Parliament will cause inconvenience and even economic hardship. The fact that Kenya is in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic only exacerbates the potential impact of the decision. Yet that is the clear result Kenyans desired for Parliament’s failure to enact legislation they deemed necessary. We must never forget that more often than not, there is no gain without pain,” Mr Maraga said on Monday while recommending the dissolution of Parliament by President Kenyatta.

“Consequently, it is my constitutional duty to advise Your Excellence to dissolve Parliament under Article 261(7) of the constitution,” the CJ further said.

Section 27 of the Constitution requires both levels of government to ensure that neither gender has more than two thirds of public officers, whether elected or appointed.

Under the two-thirds gender rule, the dominant gender should only occupy 66.66 per cent of public offices. Currently, men dominate the National Assembly as only 59 out of 349 MPs are female. This means that the 290 male MPs occupy 83 per cent of available seats. In the Senate, the 47 male lawmakers account for 70 per cent of the available seats.

National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi however criticised the CJ’s decision and defended Parliament saying it been wrongly castigated for failure to enact the relevant legislation. “More importantly, there is no express constitutional edict directed at Parliament requiring it to pass legislation to ensure compliance with the two-thirds gender principle with respect to Members of Parliament,” he said

Mr Muturi said the clamour for dissolution of the current Parliament on account of failure to enact the two-third gender legislation is at the very least, unrealistic.

“In fact, dissolution of Parliament will necessitate a by-election in all constituencies, nearly akin to a General Election. Given the expensive nature of elections as exemplified by the last 2017 General Elections, there does not appear to be any good reason for insisting on dissolution of Parliament,” he said.

Mr Muturi claimed that various electoral laws may need to be amended for more women to be elected to Parliament.

Sam Kiplagat,"Kenyans will pay for brutality against University of Nairobi students by General Service Unit officers four years ago. 

In a report seen by the Nation, Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji has recommended that the students be compensated. The report further recommended police training on fundamental human rights.

Some 43 students were injured when anti-riot police officers beat them up on April 2, 2016, within the university premises and on Lower State House Road near the YMCA.

The previous day, the students had conducted elections for their student body, the University of Nairobi Students Association (UNSA).

The elections later turned violent after students rioted protesting the outcome.

Investigations conducted by IPOA show that scores of students were pulled from halls of residents, frog-marched to Lower State House Road, made to lie on the tarmac and beaten up.

Some of the female students claimed that they were sexually assaulted by the police but they failed to report because, according to the report, the students did not trust the police to investigate and hold their colleagues to account.

A video of students lying on the tarmac while being beaten with batons was widely circulated but the police denied the claims.

A number of students were also arrested and taken to Central Police station but were later released without charges being preferred against them.

Some of the students were injured when they jumped from second floor as they tried to escape.

In the report, Mr Moses Omirera from the DPP’s office has also recommended administrative action against chief Inspector Stanley Mbuvi for being negligent. 

He said Mr Mbuvi should be held accountable for the violations committed by the officers under his command during the operation.

Sam Kiplagat,"A former administrator has moved to the appellate court seeking to compel former Cabinet minister Noah Wekasa to pay him Sh6 million for the purchase a 20-acre parcel of land in Kitale 11 years ago.

Davis Nathan Chelogoi lost the claim against Dr Wekesa in February this year after a judge dismissed his case. But he argues that a significant portion of the politician’s defence was premised on illegalities because he allegedly used documents that were either forged or altered to defeat his case.

The former provincial commissioner wants in the alternative, Dr Wekesa compelled to return the parcels in Kapkoi area, Trans Nzoia county.

Justice Samson Okong'o of the Land and Environment Court dismissed the case in February saying Mr Chelogoi was not entitled to any other payment from Dr Wekesa.

“With regard to the alternative claim, no basis was laid to warrant the rescission of the agreement for sale dated 10th September, 2009 that was fully performed,” the Judge said.

Justice Dr Wekesa was involved in illegal and fraudulent alterations of the sale agreement to obtain a loan from Parliamentary Service Commission (PSC), which he would otherwise not have been entitled to.

“The court will express its disapproval to such conduct by denying the defendant costs of the suit,"" the judge ruled in February.

"
Sam Kiplagat,"A case has been filed against proposed constitutional amendments under the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI), whose report is due to be submitted to President Uhuru Kenyatta and Orange Democratic Movement leader Raila Odinga.

Five activists, including economist David Ndii, moved to the High Court seeking orders to block planned changes to the Constitution to expand the Executive, given the BBI report proposes introduction of the posts of Prime Minister and deputy premiers.

The petitioners, including Jerotich Seii, James Ngondi, Wanjiku Gikonyo and Ikal Angelei, want the court to declare that Chapter Nine of the Constitution (Executive) cannot be amended either by Parliament or through popular initiative (referendum).

Other chapters that they want declared “unamendable” and “eternity clauses” are Chapter One on Sovereignty of the People and Supremacy of the Constitution, Chapter Two on The Republic, Chapter Four on the Bill of Rights and Chapter Ten on the Judiciary.

They want a declaration that the five chapters and their provisions fall under the doctrine of the “basic structure” of a constitution and theory of “constitutional entrenchment clauses”.

The petitioners want the court to find that there is an implicit limitation to constitutional amendments in Kenya.

Should the court rule in their favour, it would derail the proposals by the team appointed by President Kenyatta and Mr Odinga following their March 2018 Handshake to end the tension following the disputed 2017 presidential vote.

The BBI task force said the new positions were aimed at making the government more inclusive.

Last month, President Kenyatta said that time had come to amend the 2010 Constitution. He added that the crafters of the document fashioned it as a work in progress.

“Ten years later, the moment to improve on it is now. We must treat a constitution as a living document that must constantly adjust to emerging realities,” President Kenyatta said in an address to the nation.

But according to the petitioners, the Executive should not be altered. They have further said the petition has raised serious constitutional issues and hence they want Chief Justice David Maraga to appoint a three-judge bench to address the case.

“The questions set out amongst other matters raised in the petition are substantial, novel and require consideration by an uneven number of judges, being not less than three to be assigned by the Chief Justice,” Ms Seii said.

They have listed the Attorney General, Speaker of the National Assembly, Speaker of the Senate and the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission as the respondents in the petition.

“Recent developments in Kenya’s legislative history confirm a threatened abrogation, contravention and violation of the five chapters of the Constitution and in particular Articles 256 and 257 by the respondents,” reads the petition.

Articles 256 talks about amendment of the Constitution by parliamentary initiative, while Article 257 is about amendment through popular initiative.

The legal foundation of the petition is premised on the constitutional theory that certain aspects of the Constitution are unchangeable, immutable and as long as the Constitution exists, they too must necessarily exist.

The BBI team has concluded its report, which will be presented to the two leaders anytime soon. Mr Odinga has declared that with the expected easing of Covid-19 restrictions, BBI campaigns, which were halted when coronavirus struck, will resume.

Sam Kiplagat,"The Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) has been allowed to collect tax amounting to Sh1.18 billion from a digital betting firm arising from unpaid taxes over a period of four years.

A five-member Tax Appeals Tribunal led by the chairman Eric Wafula ruled that Oxygen 8 East Africa Ltd failed to attach on time documents, seeking to be allowed to challenge KRA’s assessment.

Oxygen 8 is a digital company that deals in text message (SMS) value-added services and mobile financial services. The company offers bulk SMS, branding, among other services.

Documents filed before the tribunal show that KRA did an audit of the firm from July 2015 to February 2019, raising an assessment of Sh1.18 billion for withholding tax. The firm contested the assessment before the tribunal, but delayed in filing its documents challenging KRA’s bill. The firm later sought an extension to file the case out of time, an application which was opposed by KRA.

“In view of the above, the Tribunal holds that there is no affidavit by the Applicant and or its representative stating the reasons for its inability to submit the requisite documents on time and without which our hands are tied,” the Tribunal ruled.

According to the Tribunal, an application for the extension of time, must be supported by an affidavit stating the reasons for failing to submit the application on time. “We note that the requirement in law is couched in mandatory terms,” the Tribunal said.

The firm said it could not file its statements arguing that the managing director was out of the county.

The firm later sought to be allowed to file the appeal out of time, an application KRA opposed. The taxman also argued that the application was a nullity because the firm failed to include a supporting affidavit, stating the reasons for the delay.

The tribunal agreed saying the reasons for the delay must be explained in an affidavit. The Tribunal also noted that the firm had acknowledged and expressed commitment to pay 986.7 million but failed to table a payment plan.

"
Sam Kiplagat,"National Bank of Kenya (NBK) has been ordered to pay Ecobank over half-a billion shillings for a botched financing deals linked to the supply of digital driving licences.

Justice Grace Nzioka ruled that NBK had to pay Sh549.3 million based on an agreement signed three years ago, which compelled the lender to pay Ecobank on account of a firm that had been subcontracted to supply the digital driving licences.

Under the deal, NBK had committed to pay Ecobank within 150 days after inking the licence deal for a loan the lender had offered Pesa Print, to kick-start production of the second generation smart card driving licenses.

NBK has secured the Sh2.3 billion deal from National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA) for the smart card driving licences, but the lender subcontracted Pesa Print for the job.

Justice Nzioka found NBK had breached terms of the financing deal after it failed to wire payments due to Pesa Print directly to Ecobank to settle a $3.5 million loan offered to the subcontractor.

NBK said payment to Ecobank was based on it receiving payment from NTSA for the contract, arguing that the transport regulator had delayed settling the bill.

“It is crystal clear that, the payment to the Plaintiff (Ecobank) by the Defendant (NBK) was based on ‘receipt and stamping of tax invoice number 00229’ and not on receipt of payment from NTSA. The period of payment is clear,” the Judge said.

NBK maintained that it could only pay the money after receiving funds from NTSA.

Court documents showed that Pesa Print assigned all dues under the contract to Ecobank and in November 2017, the sub-contractor notified the lender that it had to pay all proceeds under invoice 00229 to Ecobank. The letter was acknowledged on November 27, 2017 and the lender undertook to settle the amount within 150 days.

After the lapse of the 150 days, Ecobank demanded payment twice in April and June 2018 but NBK requested for an extension by another 150 days. The requested was allowed but after the lapse, NBK said it was yet to get funds from NTSA.

The parties later entered into negotiations but Ecobank moved to court accusing NBK of trying to vary the terms of the assignment, by alleging that payment was subject to receipt of funds from NTSA.

NBK remained categorical that payment was subject to receipt of the funds. The parties held meetings in December where they agreed that a fresh financial guarantee to be issued. And after the issuance of the new guarantee, NBK said its obligation on payment was limited to seven days after receiving funds from NTSA. And since the funds have not been received, the payment cannot be effected.

But Justice Nzioka dismissed the defence saying, “I find and hold that the Defendant is liable to pay the Plaintiff the subject sums or proceeds of tax invoice number 00229 dated pursuant to the notice of assignment served upon it.

The Defendant has in all its correspondence to the Plaintiff has undertaken to make the payment.”

National Bank won the tender in 2015, defeating 22 companies that had also lodged bids to supply the second generation licences.

The tender was challenged in court and although the High Court allowed NBK to proceed with the project, the lender was required to raise Sh1.2 billion from a third party financial institution before the tender can proceed.

"
Sam Kiplagat,"Five Kenyans among them economist David Ndii have gone to court seeking answers on whether some aspects of the constitution can be amended in a petition that threatens to derail the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) spearheaded by President Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila Odinga.

Dr Ndii together with Jerotich Seii, James Ngondi, Wanjiru Gikonyo and Ikal Angelei want the High Court to determine three key issues among them whether the basic structure of the constitution can be amended.

“Accordingly, an amendment to the constitution cannot be made that had the effect of overthrowing or obliterating the Constitution itself. Simply put the Constitution’s basic structure is infrangible,” the petition filed through lawyer nelson Havi stated.

President Kenyatta and opposition leader Mr Odinga have been pushing for the amendment of the constitution through the BBI. Mr Odinga has already visited a number of counties in a bid to popularize the initiative.

The five, however argue that no amendment “can do violence to its basic structure and a constitution could not simply put a suicide clause which destroys itself”. “Simply put, you can’t cut your leg and expect to walk,” they said.

The petitioners want the case certified as urgent and sent to Chief Justice David Maraga to constitute a bench to determine the issues raised.

“The three questions set out hereinabove, amongst other matters raised in the Petition dated 16th September, 2020 are substantial, novel and require consideration by an uneven number of Judges, being not less than three to be assigned by the Chief Justice,” Mr Havi submitted.

They stated that Chapters one Sovereignty of the people and supremacy of the Constitution, Chapter Two the Republic, Chapter Four on the Bill of Rights, Chapter Nine on the Executive and Chapter Ten on the Judiciary and its provisions, among others form the basic structure of the constitution and therefore cannot be amended by Parliament under Article 256 or through popular initiative under Article 257.

They further argued that certain fundamental provisions enacted and passed by consensus during the constitution making process are non-amendable through the constitutional amending procedures and powers established by the parent Constitution.

“These “basic structures” of the constitutional are given a transcendental position under the Constitution and are kept beyond the reach of the political processes spearheaded either by the people or parliament,” the petition stated.

It is their argument that an amendment cannot depart from the scheme and purpose of the original constitution and that “the essential form and character of the government cannot be overturned through an amendment clause due to the existence of intrinsic limitations to the amendment power”.

They stated that Parliament has been barred from exercising its power with regard to certain constitutional subjects which are regarded to be the foundational basis of the constitution.

“The legal foundation is premised on the constitutional theory that certain aspects of the Constitution are unchangeable, immutable and so bound up with the fabric of the Constitution itself, that as long as the Constitution exists, they too must necessarily exist,” the petitioners said.

They also argue that an amendment must be a real amendment, and not the substitution of a new constitution’, since a wholly new constitution can be adopted only by the same authority and through the same rigorous and open process that adopted the current constitution.

"
Sam Kiplagat,"An inquest into the death of former Makueni Senator Mutula Kilonzo has ruled out foul play into his demise and called for a closure of the matter.

Mr Mutula was found dead in his bed at Kwa Kyelu Ranch on April 27, 2013 by his workers. A government report later revealed that the lawyer died of massive bleeding caused by high blood pressure.

But his family, led by his son and current Makueni Senator Mutula Kilonzo Junior, doubted the theory and claimed cover up into his sudden death. The family especially claimed that there was interference with samples taken for toxicology analysis.

Senior Resident Magistrate B.B Bartoo said there was no evidence of cover up, especially because an independent pathologist, Dr Ian Galder from UK did not testify or send a report alluding to the alleged interference with the samples.

“It is indeed sad that we lost a dedicated servant to the republic in the manner as it may. I have evaluated all the evidence presented to court through this inquest and I am in agreement with the state that there is no evidence pointing to any person(s) having a hand in the cause of death of the late Hon Mtula Kilonzo,” the court ruled.

About 15 witnesses among them his employees and family, together with doctors and police officers who rushed into his expansive ranch, testified in the inquest.

Mr Justus Sila Mwololo, who ran a butchery at Makutano Kyumbi known as Wakwatyo Muthetheni Butchery also testified. He sold the meat, which the senator ate the previous night.

Senator Mutula Junior said he was called to the ranch after a cook Mulwa Mulee, told the ranch manager, Mr Shadrack Mwaniki that “chairman” appeared dead.

ODM leader Raila Odinga organised for the pathologist from the and preliminary reports indicated that he died of a substance that had caused much bleeding. At first the doctors could not agree on the cause of the death.

But in November 2013, Prof Galder allegedly sent Mr Mutula Junior a very disturbing email concerning samples addressed to two other doctors, who also conducted the exercise. The doctor allegedly said he will not sign his final report unless he received sealed samples.

The samples, Mr Junior said, were supposed to be sealed at Nairobi hospital. He suspected cover up into his death and also dismissed the report that suggested that the pellets were consumed with Pepsi because his father never consumed carbonated drinks.

The theory that he overdosed himself was a cover up, he said adding that Mr Mutula was under constant threats.

"
Sam Kiplagat,"least 30 people died from injuries inflicted by police officers between March and June this year, official data shows, pointing to persistence in cases of police brutality.

A survey by the Independent Police Oversight Authority (Ipoa) shows that the brutality was concentrated in 15 out of the 47 counties with Nairobi topping with 20 percent of the reported cases while Mombasa, Homa Bay, Kakamega and Laikipia tied at 15 percent each.

Ipoa directly links 16 of the reported cases or 53.3 percent to the enforcement of lockdowns to contain the spread of Covid-19. The rest of the cases stemmed out of altercation between police officers and civilians over various issues including domestic rows.

“They (police officers) are a group that has easy access to lethal weapons, for example the firearms. Therefore, at the heat of the moment, discharging a bullet is likely to cause fatality with a probability of over 90 percent,” said Ipoa chairperson Anne Makori.

The reported cases include an incident late last month when a police constable based in Igembe North in Meru County, shot his girlfriend six times allegedly after a quarrel.

The 22-year-old woman was admitted to Kenyatta National Hospital, after she was shot by David Nyamweya, her boyfriend.

In June, Duncan Ndiema, another police officer pleaded not guilty to the murder of 13-year-old Yasin Moyo. The youngster was shot as he stood on a balcony at his parents’ flat in Mathare on March 30. The boy was looking at officers patrolling the streets, to enforce a night-time curfew.

Also in Nairobi, constable Beckham Osoro Orwaru was charged, following public outcry, with the killing of 26-year old Karani Kinyiri in Mathare. The death occured while the officer was enforcing curfew orders.

Mr Osoro denied shooting Mr Kinyiri dead, in Mathare Area lV, Nairobi on April 13.

Poll protesters plead for mercy as a police officer clobbers them in Nairobi in 2016. 

Separately, corporal Emmanuel Ambunya, who is attached to Kenyatta National Hospital Police Post, denied murdering a university student Carilton David Maina in Kibera slum.

The officer was accused of murdering the Leeds University student on December 22, 2018 at Laini Saba in Kibera. He was released after posting cash bail of Sh60,000.

An Administration Police (AP) officer Zaddock Ochuka Oyieka was charged in March with the murder of Daniel Mburu Wangari, a boda boda rider outside Mama Lucy Kibaki Hospital.

The rider was shot on February 18 following an argument over an unofficial Sh50 parking fee with security guards at the hospital. Mr Mburu had volunteered to rush a two-and-a-half-year-old boy, retrieved from a river in Korogocho slums to the hospital.

A survey last year by Ipoa blamed the rise of misconduct by police officers on among other issues, poor remuneration, negative public perception and lack of professionalism.

The survey also cited poor quality recruits-mostly rejects in other careers and poor working conditions characterised by high stress levels with no psychosocial support services.

Administration Police officers arrest a youth in Kisumu on October 12, 2015. 

In the performance report by Ipoa between July and December last year, the commission recommends recruitment of more police officers to ease work load especially for the AP officers who were noted to be thinly spread.

Further, the report recommended to the police to have a continuous sensitisation on adherence to the 6th Schedule of the National Police Service (NPS) Act 2011 on use of force during police operations.

“Even as we do that I believe that we should also address the root cause of incidents where officers are trigger happy,” Mrs Makori said.

The Ipoa boss added police officers should be taken for regular counselling besides training.

“Absolutely. Ipoa has consistently, in past reports, recommended need for counselling officers because some of the issues they handle are sensitive and emotionally draining.

Mrs Makori said most of the recommendations made by agency to the NPS have been implemented.

Police beat up a demonstrator in Nairobi. 

For instance, she said, the NPS recently launched a psycho-social support dubbed “Mwamko Mpya- Healing the Uniformed”. She said this was a result of Ipoa recommendations made in 2015.

Further, Interior CS Fred Matiang’i launched a national campaign to clean up police stations, which is yet another recommendation by Ipoa.

“Other recommendations may take longer to implement and Ipoa is cognisant of this fact. We have also recommended counselling and psychological support for traumatised officers. There is indication that the NPS will soon establish specialised psychosocial support units across the country,” she added.

 Samuel Owino,"Nairobi Metropolitan Services (NMS) now wants the Controller of Budget and the Senate to compel Nairobi County to release Sh253 million meant for the provision of healthcare services.

Officials from NMS led by deputy director general William Kangethe and NMS director for health services Josephine Mbae told the Senate committee on Health that despite health being one of the transferred functions, the county is yet to change signatories for the bank accounts.

This, therefore, means NMS cannot access the money to run the level two and three health facilities in the city and also to do renovations and buy drugs for the facilities.

The Sh253 million is meant for the provision of services for health centres and dispensaries in Nairobi County.

Out of the amount, Sh127 million is still being held at the Central Bank where the county government still bears the signatories while Sh126 million is held at the County Revenue Fund.

“The Sh127 million held in Special Purpose Account (SPA) of the County in the Central Bank meant to benefit health centres is still held by the county and the signatories to the account have not been changed to officers of NMS mandated to execute the function of health,” Mr Kangethe told the committee in a virtual meeting yesterday.

“These funds are conditional grants from the Ministry of Health and attract penalties when not expended for the correct purpose and when not spent at the correct time,” Mr Kangethe added.

Dr Mbae told the committee that NMS has already written a letter to the Controller of Budget not to allow the county to spend the money because it is meant for health services now under NMS.

Despite holding the Sh253 million, Dr Mbae told the committee that the county government has dutifully transferred all the health facilities to NMS but with no resources to manage them.

 Samuel Owino,"The Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) has suspended Kilifi North MP Owen Baya Party from his position as deputy organising secretary citing lack of commitment to party affairs.

The resolution to suspend the Kilifi North was reached during a two-day retreat of the party’s National Executive Committee that took place in Athi River.

“Cognisant of the central role that the party's NEC plays in the management of the party and the need to maintain the probity of its deliberations, the NEC resolved to suspend Mr Owen Baya from membership of this critical organ and from his position as deputy organising secretary, given his recent public utterances and conduct that have cast doubt on his commitment to this party and its objectives,” ODM Secretary-General Edwin Sifuna announced in a statement on Saturday.

Mr Baya has fallen out without ODM, whose leader is Mr Raila Odinga, and has been politically associating with Deputy President William Ruto.

In July, during the heated debate on the revenue-sharing formula, he led a host of Coast MPs allied to the DP in criticising Mr Odinga, accusing him of betraying the region due to his stand on a proposed formula and parliamentary jobs.

The lawmaker was also among those at DP Ruto’s home on Thursday, during a meeting with Mr Feisal Bader Abdallah, who announced that he will participate in the Msambweni by-election as an independent candidate.

Athman Shariff (Lamu East), Mohammed Ali (Nyali),Khatib Mwashetani (Lunga Lunga) and Aisha Jumwa (Malindi) also attended that meeting.

Mr Baya’s presence was the clearest indication that he will be vouching for a candidate other than the one sponsored by his party.

"
 Samuel Owino,"The Cancer Prevention and Control (Amendment) Bill, 2019, yesterday received overwhelming support from Members of Parliament during the debate in the morning session.

Sponsored by Homa Bay Woman Representative Gladys Wanga, the bill seeks to amend Cancer Prevention and Control Act 2012 to include cancer treatment as part of the provision of primary healthcare.

Ms Wanga wants the National Cancer Institute allowed to train medical, paediatric and radiation therapy oncologists. Further, Ms Wanga wants the institute to collaborate with the Health department to train oncology nurses, physicists, and other healthcare providers.

If the bill is passed and assented to by President Kenyatta, it will come as a great relief to thousands of cancer patients who have to travel to Nairobi to get quality and affordable treatment as it advocates for the treatment of cancer at the basic level.

Kathiani MP Robert Mbui termed the bill as progressive, saying, cancer affects everyone and there should be concerted effort to tame it.

Nyandarua Woman Representative Faith Gitau said cancer should be treated at the basic level to ease the disease burden in the population.

“One of the problems we have had in this country is late detection of cancer. This bill, if passed, will ensure that cancer detection and treatment is done at the lowest community level,” Ms Gitau said. 

Her Siaya counterpart Christine Ombaka said there is also need for health facilities to reduce the cost of screening and treatment as it is out of reach for many Kenyans.

“Treatment of cancer is expensive. That’s why many people fear going to hospital. We need to ensure that we reduce the cost in our hospitals,” Dr Ombaka said.

The bill also proposes training of more oncologists, who will then be available to many people, especially in the rural areas, who currently lack access to specialised medics.

The bill also champions the promotion of e-health and telemedicine in the prevention and treatment of cancer.

Ms Wanga said this provision will be a great milestone as it will enable doctors across the country to share information on cancer treatment.

"
 Samuel Owino,"A parliamentary committee wants the Judiciary to come up with legislative proposals to allow the Deputy Chief Justice to act in the absence of the Chief Justice. 

The National Assembly Justice and Legal Affairs Committee raised concern that with CJ David Maraga set to retire in January 2021, there could be a crisis hence the need to have Deputy Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu step in.

The committee chaired by Kangema MP Muturi Kigano said it was important to have a temporary holder of office until a new one is recruited by the Judicial Service Commission.

Article 163 (2) of the Constitution states that for a proper sitting ,the Supreme Court should have five judges. While in the absence of CJ Maraga the Supreme Court will still be properly constituted, DCJ Mwilu is currently facing a case in court and if this is contested, the apex court could be left with only four judges.

Ms Mwilu’s case is currently before the Court of Appeal where she is facing abuse of office charges.

Appearing before the legal committee alongside members of the Judicial Service Commission yesterday, CJ Maraga confirmed he would be proceeding for his 30 days terminal leave on December 12 and that he would be back in office on January 12 — his last day in office.

“I will take my terminal leave on December 12 but the Judicial Service Commission cannot start the process of recruiting when I’m away, I will still be the Chief Justice,” Mr Maraga told the committee.

Mr Maraga, 69, is expected to leave office on January 12 upon attaining 70 years as stipulated by the Constitution.

Minority Whip Junet Mohamed said once the CJ takes his terminal leave, it can only be concluded that his term has ended because he will be reporting back on his last day.

“If the term ends on January 12, can the Deputy Chief Justice act while he is away?” posed Mr Mohamed.

Homa Bay Town MP Peter Kaluma said: “It should be confirmed to us that if there would be any constitutional crisis, who steps in the office once the Chief Justice is out of office.”

But Mr Maraga clarified that being away on terminal leave does not amount to his office being vacant.

On the tussle between the Judiciary and the executive over the pending appointment of the 41 judges, Mr Maraga said JSC had done its part and the matter is now out of its hands.

However the media was locked out when MPs pressed on the CJ to disclose the adverse report that was presented to President Kenyatta that has made him to delay in appointing the judges.

“This is a matter that I would like to discuss in camera,” CJ Maraga said.

MPs raised concerns that the majority of courts across are still closed due to lack of judges and wanted to know what Judiciary is doing to address the situation.

 Samuel Owino,"Each of the 47 counties will have a national referral hospital if a legislative proposal set to be introduced in the National Assembly is passed. 

The National Referral Health Facilities Bill, 2020, sponsored by Homa Bay Woman Representative Gladys Wanga, also seeks to upgrade all level five hospitals to referral status.

The Bill is set to be introduced for first reading later this month, with Ms Wanga expressing optimism that it will be considered before the end of the year.

“The Bill proposes the transformation of level five hospitals to national referral hospitals and having a referral facility in each county. The Bill also generally aims at improving the management of referral health facilities and also enhancing the healthcare facilities in the country,” reads the Bill.

Currently, the country has only six national referral hospitals namely Kenyatta University Teaching and Referral Hospital, Kenyatta National Hospital and Othaya Teaching and Referral Hospital.

Others are Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital, Mathari National Teaching and Referral Hospital and the National Spinal Injury Referral Hospital

There are level five hospitals in some counties, including Meru, Embu, Garissa, Kakamega Kisii, Kisumu, Machakos, Mombasa, Nakuru and Nyeri.

The national government currently gives counties with referral hospitals a conditional grant of Sh4.3 billion. In the Bill, Ms Wanga wants the money to be channelled directly to the hospitals instead of counties.

Ms Wanga said that if the Bill is passed into law, it will reduce congestion at the Kenyatta National Hospital, which she said is overstretched with cases that can be handled at the county level.

“There is need to bring specialised services at the county level so that people reduce the countless trips to KNH,” Ms Wanga said.

If passed into law and implemented, the Parliamentary Budget Office has said the construction of the 47 referral hospitals will cost taxpayers Sh236 billion.

In the Bill, Ms Wanga wants the money channelled directly to the hospitals’ accounts instead of county bank accounts.

She said if it is passed into law, pressure will ease on the ever-congested Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH) leading to improved services.

“There is need to bring specialised services at the county level so that people reduce the countless trips they make to KNH seeking treatment,” Ms Wanga said.

“Why should our people go India for minor operations and surgeries which can be done locally? These are the issues the Bill will cure is passed into law,” Ms Wanga added.

She is also seeking to have a legal framework for the improvement of the management of the national referral health facilities through an establishment of an eight member council committee.

 Samuel Owino,"A parliamentary investigation has concluded that the Sh63 billion leasing of medical equipment for counties was a “criminal enterprise” designed to enrich a few individuals but fell short of naming those responsible. 

Senators recommended all public officers found culpable of illegalities in the Managed Equipment Service (MES) procurement, which they said was done “in the furtherance of the adverse commercial interests” at the expense of Kenyans be prosecuted and barred from holding public office. 

The report by the Senate ad-hoc Committee said that, although the programme had a noble goal to help the public access quality healthcare, the persons involved “from start to finish implemented the project in a manner that violated the very constitution and the sacred principles it was originally conceived under.”

According to the report tabled in the House Tuesday, the project signed at State House Nairobi in 2015 had a pre-determined outcome as the suppliers of the multi-million equipment were well known by Ministry of Health officials even before tenders were advertised.

The Ministry of Health went on a buying spree despite a needs assessment confirming that counties lacked adequate capacity to absorb the equipment.

Some of the equipment was either overpriced, substandard, delivered late, or not delivered at all and the committee recommends that private firms as well as individuals found culpable of illegal acts in procurement should be barred from doing business with both levels of government.

“As a matter of fact, the committee has established that the MES project was a criminal enterprise shrouded in opaque procurement processes and that the Ministry of Health relied on a faulty tool to justify a pre-determined outcome in relation to the award of tenders that likely resulted to impudent use of public Finance Management Act that forbids wasteful expenditure,” reads the report.

“The MES project is the only project where conditional grants meant for county governments and appropriated under the County Allocation of Revenue Acts are unconstitutionally paid directly to the Ministry of Health instead of being deposited in the respective County Revenue Funds contrary to Article 207 of the Constitution,” the report further reads.

To amend this, the Committee recommends that money meant for the project should be deposited to the County Revenue Fund as required by the Constitution.

The tenders of the project were awarded to Shenzhen Mindary Bio Medical electronics Co.Ltd, Esteem Industries,M/S Sysmex Europe, GMBH, Bellco S.R.L, Philips Medical Systems Nederland BV, GE East Africa Services Limited.

The Committee faulted Ministry of Health officials who continuously undermined the role of the Attorney General as the principal legal adviser to the government by concealing material facts and disregarding the AG’s advice. When he testified before the committee in July former Attorney-General Githu Muigai said his advice on the project was ignored.

 Samuel Owino,"Matatus will no longer be allowed to access the Central Business District (CBD) as from November as the Nairobi Metropolitan Services (NMS) moves to de-congest the city.

Appearing before the National Assembly Committee on Administration and National Security, NMS Director General Mohammed Badi said plans to de-congest the city are being finalised and will be launched by President Uhuru Kenyatta in November.

He told the committee that NMS has been working with the National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA), adding that bus stations have been built in Ngara and Parklands where all matatus coming from Thika will offload passengers.

Matatus coming from Machakos and Lang’ata will have a stage at the Railway Golf Club where the Kenya National Highways Authority (KenHA) will build an express way.

Mr Badi told MPs that KenHA has already acquired the land and NMS is now just working with the authority to set up the terminus.

He said NMS had initially set its eyes on the land where the Neno Evangelism Centre is built but a court halted the decision forcing it to look for an alternative location.

Mr Badi said NMS is also working with Kenya Railways to ensure that all their lines are operational. To ease traffic on Haile Selassie Avenue through to Jogoo Road, Mr Badi Kenha will build an expressway from the Kenya Planters Cooperative Union (KPCU) building that will go straight to Jogoo road.

Mr Badi revealed that much-awaited bus rapid transit (BRT) system will also be operational by the end of this month and will be used to transport passengers from the train stations to their various destinations.

The buses ordered from South Africa have to conform to the KS-372 body-building standards developed by the Kenya Bureau of Standards. In January, Transport cabinet secretary James Macharia announced that the first batch of Sh1.6 billion high-capacity buses will arrive from South Africa in a matter of weeks.

The BRT corridors are to be marked by red lines. Line 1 is to run from James Gichuru Road/Waiyaki Way to JKIA, a distance of 20kms.

Line 2, which is 31kms long, will run from Lang’ata Road to Ngong Road, Juja Road, Komarock Road to Ruiru. It will have major stops at Dandora, Kariobangi and near Gikomba market.

Line 3 will run from Githurai through Thika Road to Moi Avenue in the CBD and terminate at Kenyatta National Hospital. Line 4 will cover 14km from T-Mall to Jogoo Road while Line 5 will cover Outering Road.

Should Mr Bad’s plans pull through, he will have succeeded where both current Nairobi governor Mike Sonko and hie predecessor Evans Kidero failed.

 Samuel Owino,"The woes of suspended Kemsa CEO Jonah Manjari continued to pile Wednesday after Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe and Principal Secretary Susan Mochache distanced themselves from the agency’s multi-billion-shilling Covid-19 scandal. 

Mr Kagwe told the National Assembly’s Health Committee, which is investigating the scandal, that at no time did he instruct Mr Manjari to break rules in procurement of Covid-19 materials.

And as the clock ticks towards the three weeks given by President Kenyatta to unravel the mystery of the alleged loss of Covid-19 billions at the medical supplies agency, it is now turning out to be a blame game between the ministry and Kemsa bosses on who should take responsibility for the mess.

Although CS Kagwe admitted giving instructions to Kemsa CEO on a number of issues related to Covid-19 supplies, he said that was not a ticket to commit a crime or act in an illegal way.

Mr Kagwe said in any government operation, if an illegal instruction is given, then a recipient has a right to ask that it be put in writing, which Kemsa didn’t do.

“At no time did I propose to anyone not to follow procurement rules. If you go wrong then it’s not because the CS told you, it’s because you’re a poor manager,” Mr Kagwe said.

The CS explained to the Sabina Chege-led committee that when the country was in crisis as the positive cases continued to soar after the first case, he was communicating constantly with agencies under the ministry to provide solutions to Kenyans.

“I have engaged Kemsa repeatedly and it’s my job to do so. We consult continuously. However, it’s not my job to tell someone to commit an irregularity,” Mr Kagwe said.

“It is not my job to micro-manage agencies under the ministry. I was communicating directly with Kemsa because everyone across the country was screaming for Personal Protective Equipment and it would have been irresponsible for me to just sit in my office and wait for things to happen.”

Health Principal Secretary Susan Mochache told MPs at no time did she write any letter to Kemsa directing on how to go about procurement.

“At no time did the ministry give Kemsa a list of suppliers. What we did as a ministry was to rationalise the budget that was presented to us,” Ms Mochache said. 

“I only wanted to ensure that their budget was within the Sh758 million as provided by the World Bank.”

She accused the agency of going on a buying spree without minding their budget provision.

Last week, Kemsa board chairman Kembi Gitura told the same committee that the agency received a letter dated April 15 and signed by PS Mochache with specifications on where to procure, listing specific suppliers they were to source from, as well as the prices.

The PS denied the alleged letter.

Mr Kagwe further told Kemsa to carry their own cross in surpassing their budget, terming the move as irresponsible.

“If you surpassed the budget approved by the board, then you’re personally responsible for that decision,”CS Kagwe said

The medical agency spent Sh7.2 billion on procurement of Covid-19 materials without approval of the board against the approved budget by board of Sh4.5 billion.

On Friday, Mr Manjari told the committee that he would occasionally receive phone calls and text messages from either Mr Kagwe or Ms Mochache on issues related to procurement.

"
 Samuel Owino,"Members of Parliament are racing against time to enact electoral laws to guide the conduct of a referendum, appointment of poll commissioners and procurement of election equipment.

Among the pending Bills is one to establish a procedure for recruitment of Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) commissioners. 

Only three are in office — Mr Wafula Chebukati, Prof Abdi Guliye and Mr Boya Molu—following the resignation of four others.  Ms Connie Nkatha, Ms Margaret Mwachanya and Mr Paul Kurgat quit in 2018 while Roselyn Akombe had resigned the previous year.  

Without a legal basis for the appointment of a selection panel, the recruitment of new IEBC commissioners cannot be done.

The selection panel that recruited the current team was dissolved and MPs are haggling over the membership of a new team, which is interpreted as an attempt to influence the appointment of new poll commissioners.

The new laws are also necessary to enable IEBC conduct a referendum — the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) reforms are expected to occasion a plebiscite — and for ensuring free and fair elections in 2022.

National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi has told MPs to conclude the stalled electoral reforms bills with the country heading to the polls in 23 months — a month short of the period within which IEBC says legal changes on conduct of elections should be in place.

Prof Guliye has said the commission has reminded MPs that new legal provisions should be enacted at least two years before the next elections so as not to interfere with preparations for the polls.

Among the proposed laws pending in Parliament are the Election Campaign Financing (Amendment) Bill, the IEBC (Amendment) Bill and the Referendum Bill.

The IEBC (Amendment) Bill seeks to amend section 36 of the IEBC Act to guide the redrawing of electoral boundaries. All these reforms are lagging behind schedule as concern mounts that parliament may wait until the last minute to pass the laws.

Mr Muturi has asked the newly reconstituted Justice and Legal Affairs committee under the leadership of Muturi Kigano and his Rarieda counterpart Otiende Amollo to prioritise the proposed laws.

“Let us not wait for too long and start burning the midnight oil, we can be proactive and do what needs to be done early. Justice and Legal and Affairs committee, the ball is in your court,” he said.

"
 Samuel Owino,"MPs want the elusive two-thirds gender requirement on elective posts deleted through a referendum, arguing it is impossible to attain.

The lawmakers argue that it is not possible to force Kenyans to vote a woman candidate in a democratic exercise; hence the requirement should be deleted and only observed in appointive positions.

The Constitution Implementation Oversight Committee Chairman Jeremiah Kioni said the two-thirds gender rule was only agreed by politicians during the drafting of the 2010 Constitution to stabilise the country and cool tempers.

 “There is none of the formulas that have a solution to the implementation of this rule because you cannot take away my right on who to vote for. It is not implementable,” Mr Kioni said in a plenary discussion on the thorny issue on Thursday.

 “This is our Constitution, let us live with its contents. Let’s change what we can and live with other provisions, and I don’t think someone can dissolve Parliament over two-thirds gender rule.” National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi said Parliament has done what is humanly possible to implement the rule, but has not made headway.

“You cannot compel citizens to elect either men or the other gender,” Mr Muturi said.

Deputy Minority Whip Maoka Maore said execution of the two-thirds rule amounts to preferential treatment of one gender and cannot work on elective positions.

 “I have a daughter in high school, why I’m I not allowed to pay less school because of her gender,” posed Mr Maore.

After failing a record five times to pass the two-thirds Gender Bill, anyone at the moment can petition the Chief Justice, who shall then advise the President to dissolve Parliament.

The Law Society of Kenya (LSK) has petitioned the CJ on the matter. However, Majority Leader Amos Kimunya scoffed at the LSK petition.

 “There are some noises being made outside there by somebody calling himself a President of a society that he can dissolve Parliament. Let us see if he can do that,” Mr Kimunya said.

According to Rarieda MP Otiende Amollo, dissolution of Parliament on account that it is not properly constituted may also mean that all the laws it has passed since 2016 are illegal.

Dr Amollo, who is one of the drafters of the 2010 Constitution having sat in the Committee of Experts, said the only way out of the situation is to delete the requirement from the Constitution, a move which will require a referendum.

 “We have a looming danger because where we are today, it is possible for the President to dissolve Parliament and we go for fresh elections,” Dr Amolo said.

He, however, said the dissolution of the chambers of the House may not provide a solution, saying even in the fresh polls more men will find way back to Parliament and the cycle may continue.

Murang’a Woman Rep Sabina Chege, however, said there is still room for conversations on the matter and it should not be seen as a woman but a gender issue.

Section 27 of the Constitution requires both levels of government to ensure that neither gender has more than two-thirds of public officers, whether elected or appointed.

Under the rule, the dominant gender should only occupy 66 per cent of public offices. Currently, men dominate the National Assembly as only 59 out of 349 MPs are female.

There have been four attempts by the National Assembly to enact the Gender Bill, with the most recent one being on February 27 last year.

The bill was supposed to have been enacted within the first five years after the promulgation of the new Constitution.

 Samuel Owino,"The names and faces of officials who may have presided over multi-billion-shilling Covid-19 scandals have started coming to light as investigations gather steam.

On Thursday, bosses at the Kenya Medical Supplies Authority (Kemsa), where the bulk of irregular procurement of supplies happened, placed Health Principal Secretary Susan Mochache at the centre of the scams.

The Kemsa managers, led by board chairman Kembi Gitura, said Ms Mochache ordered the agency to exclusively procure Covid-19 related from specific companies and at set prices. 

Appearing before the National Assembly’s Health Committee over alleged loss of billions of shillings, the management absolved itself from any procurement irregularity, saying, they took orders from Ms Mochache.

Mr Gitura told the committee that the agency received a letter in April from the PS with details on how to go about the procurement.

Quality of PPEs

Mr Gitura told the team, chaired by Ms Sabina Chege, that the letter from the PS had instructions on what to buy, where and at what cost, a move he said was not procedural as the medical agency is not supposed to be directed on what to do by the ministry.

“We received a letter from the Ministry of Health containing a list where we should procure from, the prices and the quantity. I can vouch on the quality of PPEs we procured,” Mr Gitura said.

Mr Gitura admitted that, although the directive by the PS was irregular, it does not amount to an illegality of the procurement of PPEs done by Kemsa.

In the latter dated April 15 addressed to suspended CEO Jonah Manjari, which the Nation saw, Ms Mochache said the World Bank had identified and approved various items to be procured.

“This is to approve the procurement of goods worth Sh758, 690,583 as outlined in the annex. Disregard all other requests made in relation to Covid-19 as they have been captured under this approval,” the PS’s letter reads.

Cherangany MP Joshua Kutuny said the directive by the ministry amounted to an irregularity as it flouted the tender rules.

“The money should have been given to Kemsa and a tender floated for companies to bid,” Mr Kutuny said.

The Health ministry had during its appearance before the committee denied directing Kemsa on what to buy. The committee has now invited the PS back to authenticate the letter she allegedly signed and sent to Kemsa.

Documents tabled before the committee indicate that companies such as  Tikasan Holdings Co Ltd, KEMA Ltd, Medilab and Applied Products have already pocketed millions of shillings for the supply of PPEs to the agency.

For instance, according to the document Kemsa tabled, Tikasan got Sh4.4 million, and Applied Products Sh417, 000.

Other firms that supplied various items and are awaiting payment include F and S Scientific Ltd (Sh25.4 million), Chemoquip Ltd (Sh4.1 million), Faram Limited (Sh3.2 million) among others.

MPs were told Kemsa is still holding stock of PPEs worth Sh6.2 billion in its warehouse despite majority of healthcare workers across the country lacking the protective gear.

The agency is on the spot after it procured the N95 (1860) masks at Sh1, 300 against the market price of Sh700 apiece. It paid Sh700 for the KN95 mask that goes for 450 on the higher side. The agency ordered 1,836,400 of these.

The prices should be lower considering that Kemsa was buying in bulk.

The disposable three-ply surgical masks were bought at Sh90 apiece against the market price of Sh50 when bought in bulk.

A study by the Health ministry and World Health Organization done last year revealed that some drugs in Kenya were being sold at double the international prices, or even higher.

Dr Manjari was suspended alongside directors Eliud Muriithi (Commercial) and Charles Juma (Procurement). National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi directed the Health and Public Investments Committees to launch investigations into the scandals.

Mr Muturi said it is the duty of MPs as outlined under article 95 to oversight how funds given to various agencies are used

“The National Assembly is appalled by the alleged misuse of ... resources and the Health Committee and the Public Investment committee must move with speed and offer leadership on this matter. We have no time to waste,” Mr Muturi said.

Mr Gitura told MPs that the agency should not be vilified without facts and that the investigating agencies must be allowed to complete investigations.

“We shall take responsibility if and when required. So far people are just speaking without facts,” Mr Gitura said.

He said they are ready to open all their warehouses across the country for the public to confirm that all PPEs bought by the government and those donated are intact.

 Samuel Owino,"Members of Parliament now want the Kazi Mtaani initiative launched by President Uhuru Kenyatta halted saying it was poorly planned and is an avenue to embezzle public funds.

The lawmakers told National Treasury Cabinet Secretary Ukur Yattani that the initiative is not viable and the government needs to go back to the drawing board in a bid to structure the project in an efficient way.

Speaking Wednesday during the second day of the third National Assembly leadership retreat, the lawmakers complained that majority of the youth especially in the constituencies have been locked out of the programme.

Limuru MP Peter Mwathi said the programme is causing more division among the youth due to the exclusion of others.

Deputy Speaker Moses Cheboi said the government needs to check the value of the money paid to the youth and the work they do.

“When you go to the constituency, the youth are doing drainage today, the following day they do the same thing. If we use these young people to make desks or engage in construction, we can measure their output or utilise their skills effectively,” said Mr Cheboi. Budget and Appropriation Committee chairman Kanini Kega said the programme is not sustainable and there is need for a change of plan.

 Mr Yatani, however, insisted that the programme will continue until the end of the year as intended in order to assist the youth get back to their feet after Covid-19

Although Mr Yatani admitted that in some areas the programme was hurriedly introduced without a proper plan, he added that measures are currently in place measures to ensure it lives up to its intended objective.

“We have put up accountability measures that will be rolled out soon so that the programme can continue until the economy stabilises and the people can go back to their jobs,” Mr Yatani said.

The programme is geared at integrating jobless Kenyans in urban hygiene and sanitation work across 23 informal settlements in the country.

It provides employment and daily wages for low-income workers living in informal settlements while improving urban infrastructure and service delivery within informal settlements.

The programme aims at reaching a total population of 669,000 households across all the 290 constituencies.

The current payroll figure stands at 341,958 households and targeting for other households is still going and all needy households will be reached by October this year.

So far, out of the Sh10 billion that the government allocated for the purpose of cushioning elderly citizens, orphans and vulnerable members of the society, the government has disbursed Sh1.3 billion for phase one of the Kazi Mtaani project, Sh2.4 billion and Sh5.6 billion has been earmarked for phase three.

 Samuel Owino,"The cash crisis in counties could get worse after Attorney-General Paul Kihara said Treasury cannot disburse the equitable share revenue without the approval of the National Assembly.

Mr Kihara told MPs on Monday to step in and resolve the stalemate on the Division of Revenue in the Senate pending enactment of the County Allocation Revenue Act (Cara).

In an advisory opinion, the AG said Treasury Cabinet Secretary Ukur Yatani cannot release 50 per cent of the total equitable share to counties without the approval of the National Assembly because the stalemate is not about the Division of Revenue Bill but Cara.

Division of Revenue Bill defines how money is split between the two levels of government while Cara states how funds allocated to devolved units are shared among specific counties. In an advisory opinion prompted by the Council of Governors last year, the Supreme Court said the National Assembly would be required to authorise the withdrawal of money from the Consolidated Fund in the event an impasse occurs between it and the Senate over the Division of Revenue Bill.

The apex court said the move would safeguard county governments while affording Parliament an opportunity to resolve the deadlock through mediation.

However, the AG clarified that the Supreme Court opinion referred to an impasse around passage of the Division of Revenue Bill but noted that in the current situation, the deadlock revolves around the enactment of Cara for the 2020/2021 financial year.

The AG argued that any appropriation from the Consolidated Fund in the financial year, except supplementary appropriation, has to be authorised by Parliament.

Meanwhile, the Commission on Revenue Allocation (CRA) has maintained that the proposed third basis formula is the best. Ms Kiringai said the formula is a win-win for all parties, adding that counties that would lose in equitable share would be cushioned by the Equalisation Fund.

“We need to be alive to that fact and even after we update the formula with the current census data, you will see significant changes in the county allocations. So, these counties should be cushioned by setting aside an Equalisation Fund of at least 15 per cent of the total revenue,"" Ms Kiringai told the Nation. Laikipia Governor Ndiritu Muriithi said the proposal sought to streamline the procedure used to allocate funds to counties.

""Whereas most of us agree that there are some historical imbalances to be addressed, it cannot be realistic to argue that a solution can only be achieved through taking away resources from those counties which are seen to have benefited from development in the past. This will create the basis for further conflict,"" he said.

On Monday, a lobby group urged senators to shelve their personal differences and unlock the revenue impasse. The Institute for Social Accountability said the debate has been turned into a political contest.

“The debate risks dividing the country right down the middle by pitting perceived losing and winning counties against each other,” the lobby said in a statement.

At the same time, the Union of Kenya Civil Servants has threatened a nationwide strike by county employees over unpaid salaries. 

The Union of Kenya Civil Servants (UKCS) yesterday gave county governments seven days to pay June and July salaries.  Secretary General Tom Odege said they have resorted to the action because talks with County governments have been unsuccessful.

Mr Odege, who is also the Nyatike MP, said he regretted resorting to industrial action during a pandemic, but blamed counties for ignoring diplomacy. 

“The delayed salaries are impacting negatively on the lives of civil servants and their families. It can only be attributed to mismanagement and lack of prudent financial skills by the county governments,” Mr Odege said.

He complained that, despite the national government setting aside funds for allowances of health workers, most counties were yet to pay. He also protested the failure to promote employees.

"
 Samuel Owino,"Aspirants seeking to contest for elective posts on the Orange Democratic Movement ticket in 2022 should prepare for a shocker as the party is seeking to change its nomination rules.

ODM’s National Chairman John Mbadi told the Nation that the party is determined to have transparent nominations and is working on the changes.

Mr Mbadi said the new National Election Board (NEB), chaired by Catherine Mumma, has been tasked with reviewing nomination rules that will apply ahead of the next General Election.

“We have trained the board early enough so that it can come up with new party primaries and nomination rules that will make [the process] easy and [enhance] accountability,” the Suba South MP said.

He pointed out that the reconstitution of the NEB as well as the internal disciplinary committee is part of the change process ahead of 2022.

A report commissioned by ODM after the 2017 polls blamed its secretariat, the National Executive Committee and NEB for the disputed loss.

“The biggest concern with ODM is failure to respect its own constitution and regulations. The party structures are clear, from the grassroots to the top, but the implementation of the constitution and the functionality of the structures, particularly at the grassroots, is wanting,” states the report.

The report specifically accused the three organs of deliberately bungling party primaries

“This is not a journey we started yesterday but immediately after the 2017 elections. We sat down and evaluated our performance and what we need to do ahead of 2022,” Mr Mbadi said.

“We lost a number of our members in the last election because our nominations had many pitfalls.”

ODM Secretary-General Edwin Sifuna confirmed the party is working on modalities to get it right in 2022 but did not give details on the expected changes.

During the opening of the ODM office in Lavington, Nairobi, last year, deputy leader Wycliffe Oparanya (Kakamega governor) urged party leader Raila Odinga to decisively deal with cartels in the secretariat, saying they bungle nominations each election cycle

“ODM is still powerful at the grassroots but has lost numbers both in the National Assembly and the Senate. We must ask ourselves why,” Mr Oparanya said.

Although Mr Mbadi did not outline the specific changes expected since they will be drawn by the new election board that has been undergoing training in Machakos, he said MCA aspirants must have better academic qualifications.

He noted on Saturday that MCAs play an important role unlike the county council members of the past, so their academic qualifications must be higher for those seeking ODM tickets.

“These people oversee budgets worth billions of shillings yet some sitting in the budget committee have no idea how a budget should be done,” Mr Mbadi said.

The law requires MCA candidates to have at least a Form Four certificate.

The National Assembly in 2012 amended several sections of the Political Parties Act and other electoral laws ahead of the 2013 General Election but this was suspended.

MPs and their counterparts in the counties only needed to have a three-month post-secondary certificate to be eligible to contest in 2013.

In 2016, Justice and Legal Affairs Committee chair Samuel Chepkong’a proposed a minimum qualification of a degree or a diploma certificate for those vying for the MCA seat.

Although this was passed, its implementation was suspended until 2022.

"
 Samuel Owino,"Some of the young people employed on the government’s economic stimulus programme Kazi Mtaani cannot be paid through their mobile phones because their lines have been blocked for failure to settle Fuliza overdraft loans.

Others have had their wages withheld because they furnished the government with mobile numbers of their relatives, which do not match their personal details, to evade debt payment.

The payment hitch, disclosed in a report by the National Assembly Committee on Labour and Social Services, shows the youth’s addiction to mobile loans that are easy to access in small amounts but are priced higher compared to credit from banks and saccos.

Most of the young people are hooked to Safaricom’s  credit service Fuliza, which is linked to mobile money platform M-Pesa and is designed to deduct the outstanding debt automatically within 24 hours.

“Some youth had blocked or frozen numbers due to having taken Fuliza loan from Safaricom,” the report says.

“Some used IDs that belong to other family members. The challenge is that the details provided do not match their ID numbers, resulting in pay delay.”

Fuliza was introduced in January 2019 and is popular among low-income earners who take loans of less than Sh2,000 for their daily needs, with the debt settled after sales are made or wages received.

In the Kazi Mtaani programme, the youth are hired for 11 days and are compensated at a rate of Sh455 per day. This is down 30 per cent from the Sh650 daily wage rate when the short-term employment programme was launched on April 29.

Fuliza charges a facility fee of 1.083 per cent or 395.2 per cent annualised, underlining the high cost of using the short-term credit service regularly. Most bank and sacco loans are priced from 12 per cent to 14 per cent per year but lock out people without steady income streams.

Surveys have shown many people who take digital loans are juggling credit from multiple platforms, ultimately leading to default on some of the platforms. Fuliza had lent an estimated Sh81 billion in the six months to June last year, indicating the huge demand for small loans conveniently delivered through mobile phones.

The government decided to use M-Pesa, the most popular mobile money service, to pay the young people in a convenient way that also reduces risk of handling cash in the wake of the highly infectious coronavirus.

The report to Parliament comes after various youth protested delayed payments.

Last week, Housing Principal Secretary Charles Hinga sought to assure the youth that legitimate claims would be processed after county implementation committees verified their details against returns from the paying agency.

“Payments for workers under the Kazi Mtaani programme are made via mobile money and it has been noted that some workers’ details may have had errors which resulted in their payments not going through,” Mr Hinga said.

"
 Samuel Owino,"The rise of mobile lenders has left a majority of the youth in a debt trap.

So bad is the situation that some cannot be paid their dues from the Kazi Mtaani project because of outstanding loans with Fuliza, a Safaricom product.

Since Fuliza loan is deducted automatically, most of them registered with different cell phone numbers to evade this.

“Some used IDs that belong to other family members. The challenge is that the details provided do not match their ID numbers, resulting in pay delay,” reads a report by the National Assembly Committee on Labour and Social Services.

Beneficiaries are paid a weekly stipend of Sh1,000 by the State Department of Interior and Co-ordination of the National Government through M-Pesa.

The project is located in 23 informal settlements and seeks to improve urban infrastructure and services.

However, all is not well as there have been protests over pay in Murang’a, Isiolo and Mvita.

Last week, Housing Principal Secretary Charles Hinga assured the youth that county implementation committees will capture their details, including name, ID and phone numbers, which will be verified against returns from the paying agency, adding that legitimate claims will be processed.

“Payments for workers under the Kazi Mtaani programme are made via mobile money and it has been noted that some workers’ details may have had errors which resulted in their payments not going through,” Mr Hinga said.

The project aims to reach 669,000 households across all the 290 constituencies.

The report notes that the current payroll figure stands at 341,958 households.

So far, out of the Sh10 billion allocated for the purpose of cushioning the elderly, orphans and vulnerable members of the society, the government has disbursed Sh1.3 billion for phase one, Sh2.4 billion and Sh5.6 billion has been earmarked for phase three.

 Samuel Owino,"Since Fuliza loan is deducted automatically, most of them registered with different cell phone numbers.

Beneficiaries are paid a weekly stipend of Sh1,000 by the State Department of Interior.

All is not well as there have been protests over pay in Murang’a, Isiolo and Mvita.

The rise of mobile lenders has left a majority of the youth in a debt trap.

So bad is the situation that some cannot be paid their dues from the Kazi Mtaani project because of outstanding loans with Fuliza, a Safaricom product.

Since Fuliza loan is deducted automatically, most of them registered with different cell phone numbers to evade this.

“Some used IDs that belong to other family members. The challenge is that the details provided do not match their ID numbers, resulting in pay delay,” reads a report by the National Assembly Committee on Labour and Social Services.

Beneficiaries are paid a weekly stipend of Sh1,000 by the State Department of Interior and Co-ordination of the National Government through M-Pesa.

The project is located in 23 informal settlements and seeks to improve urban infrastructure and services.

However, all is not well as there have been protests over pay in Murang’a, Isiolo and Mvita.

Last week, Housing Principal Secretary Charles Hinga assured the youth that county implementation committees will capture their details, including name, ID and phone numbers, which will be verified against returns from the paying agency, adding that legitimate claims will be processed.

“Payments for workers under the Kazi Mtaani programme are made via mobile money and it has been noted that some workers’ details may have had errors which resulted in their payments not going through,” Mr Hinga said.

The project aims to reach 669,000 households across all the 290 constituencies.

The report notes that the current payroll figure stands at 341,958 households.

So far, out of the Sh10 billion allocated for the purpose of cushioning the elderly, orphans and vulnerable members of the society, the government has disbursed Sh1.3 billion for phase one, Sh2.4 billion and Sh5.6 billion has been earmarked for phase three.

 Samuel Owino,"Investigations into the 132 acres grabbed land in Ngong Forest took a new turn Wednesday after it emerged that the titles were processed even before the land was degazetted by former minister Francis Lotodo.

The National Assembly Environment committee heard that the titles were processed between 1994 and 1996, way before Mr Lotodo degazetted the parcel in 1998.

The environment committee chaired by Maara MP Kareke Mbiuki, which is investigating the alleged grabbing of the forest land following a petition filed in the National Assembly, yesterday made a visit to the area, where they were informed of the new development.

Residents of Royal Park, Sun Valley I and II, Lang'ata Gardens, Lang'ata View Gardens and Forest Edge estates petitioned Parliament following an announcement by Mr Tobiko that the estates were built on grabbed forest land.

Kenya Forest Service Chief Surveyor Evans Kegode said the move was illegal.

""The titles for the land that Sun Valley II and Sun Valley III, Royal Palace and Royal Estates occupy were processed between 1994 and 1996, way before degazettement, which was done in 1998. This is illegal.""

Joseph Mboya,"Did you ever sashay to the beat of that cheerful song ‘Mos Mos Mama Milka’, dear Ciku, as Kabare Girls volleyball team slayed their opponents?

Did you, at any time, dear Wepukhulu, dance your feet sore to the rhythm of ‘Sisi Nike! Hao Akala!’ when Kakamega High School’s Green Commandos pummelled the opposition into submission in the national secondary schools’ soccer tournaments?

And did you ever wonder where the songs originated from?

Now, as with many tales passed down from one generation to the next, the details are a bit hazy but what I know is that back in the day, at the Kenya Railways Senior Staff Quarters on Park Road, there was an old Peugeot 404 van with the name ‘Mos Mos Mama Milka Obori’ emblazoned on the back.

I’m not quite sure whether the song predated the van or vice versa. A story of the chicken and the egg.

What I know is that this was one of our finest exports to the rest of the country, as far as high school cheering-squad songs go.

By ‘our’ I mean those of us who called the city home back then. I recently took a drive around the hoods that defined our teenage years and saying I was dazed would be an understatement.

I am sure those from our generation who migrated (kwenda majuu, as we used to say) or those who left for the hereafter would be lost if they were to come back to the estates where they grew up; especially on that stretch of land starting from Ngara through Eastleigh to the areas generally referred to as Eastlando (Eastlands).

Right near the estate where the ‘Mama Milka’ song sprung from was the famous Brilliant Hotel, or simply Brilly to the card-carrying buffs of the pulsating reggae beats with which the Amunga brothers – the late Papa Leftie and his kid brother Puppa Charley – used to bewitch us.

As Leftie or his brother Charley, aka Kalulu (a story for another day but if you ever read the famous Juha Kalulu cartoon strip in Taifa Leo you get the drift) yelled ‘Rudisha Hiyo’, meaning play the song again, the faithful would be on the dance floor, dancing themselves lame, sweat pouring from their faces.

Of course, you cannot talk about this area without talking of the Thika Superhighway, another marvel. The Thika Road of yore were two thin strips of tarmac that reminded one of the blankets used by inmates at the Kamiti Prison.

In their place today is a world-class autobahn with interchanges, underpasses and flyovers to boot. Things we only saw on TV and the open-air cinemas we religiously attended.

Heading towards Juja Road – and the place is not what it used to be. Garissa Lodge, which began as a real lodge, is now one huge souk selling anything and everything you might ever need.

Mathare slums has refused to change with the times and, although a few spirited individuals have tried their best to throw in a modern apartment block here and there, the ghetto we knew when we were young still stands strong, as if snarling, ‘gusa uone!’ (You dare touch me and see!)

I headed further down the road and Kariobangi Light Industries near the area known as Roundabout is now a real manufacturing hub, looking like it is daring Industrial Area to a duel. What used to look like a village bridge connecting Roundabout and Dandora Phase One is now an engineering marvel.

Wamwari’s stage is still going strong. The chips from this place was something to die for back in the day. Although haphazard building seems to be the new normal, if you know what you are looking for you will get it.

I know many would burn me at the stake if I dare mention that back in our day Dandora had functioning street lights, paved roads and garbage bins supplied by the Nairobi City Council or simply ‘Kanjo’. Did I mention that every Saturday a garbage truck – courtesy of our fathers at City Hall – would collect the garbage. ‘Kamero’ was the name of the trucks and I am still hard-pressed to tell the origin of that word.

Deep inside you get to Dandora Phase Two and there proudly stands the ageless Dandora Cinema building, which is now a church. Funny to think that that is where I watched the movie ‘The Day of the Jackal’ at the princely sum of Sh2.50. OK, it might appear like nothing at the current market value but, just as a guide, the fare from Dandora to the city centre was Sh2.50. Do the maths.

If you take the route back you will get to Civil Servants Estate or ‘Civoo’. In place of the well-planned estate I knew now stand eyesores in the shape of ugly buildings looking like they were erected by fundis (contractors) in a hurry to go home. Those in the know tell me a former area MP was responsible for allocating his supporters every inch of land he could lay his hands on, leading to the current mess.

It is here that I acquired the refined tastes of good rhumba music, especially Franco and the lot. My initiator-in-chief into this rarefied class was this mountain of a man who was living in one of the extensions. His name was Joshua, although Kenyans later came to know him as Orwa Ojode, the former Ndhiwa MP and an assistant minister in the Office of the President who perished alongside his good friend Prof George Saitoti in a chopper crash around Ngong Hills seven years ago.

"
Joseph Mboya,"Two interesting things happened at our club this week which made my heart exceedingly glad.

First was the announcement of the new players our administration has managed to convince to come and wear the epitome of uniform in Kenyan football- the Gor Mahia green.

Granted, ours is the team many a player would want to turn out for. However, it is not a given that all those players will make a beeline to K’Ogalo. What with the many ne’er do wells, charlatans, journeymen and the various shades of fly by night operations masquerading as football clubs fighting for the same signatures.

I am happy that we are bringing home quality players who are ready to join the pantheon of many other illustrious players of before and now who wil have their names etched in history as having turned out for our glamour club.

This is particularly important when you consider that it is just a matter of time before we take the battle to the doorsteps of some of Africa’s finest as we embark on the continental campaign.

To the newcomers I can promise you that you are coming to a club with rich tradition and a fan base so passionate that if you play well, you will be elevated to only a footstep away from being a god.

We love our players especially those who perform well. Also be ready to get a nickname because at Gor Mahia that is what we do for a living- nicknaming our star footballers.

The second thing that impressed me was the decision by the new Secretary General Sam Ocholla to hit the ground running as he seeks to streamline the finances in our club.

Year after year, the finances have proved to be the unholy grail at Gor Mahia and following its trail always end up in what social media savvy Kenyans refer to as premium tears.

A key mantra in many business schools the world over is simple- follow the money. I am sure anybody with the wellbeing of our club at heart will wholeheartedly support Bwana Ocholla in his mission.

The benefits of a streamlined finance system are legion. Granted, we have been in financial dire straits for the longest time ever and I know the Ambrose Rachier administration had been hard pressed to look for every cent and penny from every source possible.

With a good financial reporting system in place, we can confidently go to town, a begging bowl in hand seeing for potential funders. But for this to happen we must prove that we have made good use of the small amounts in our coffers.

After all, it was Jesus Christ himself who told us that if you can be trusted with little then you can be trusted with a lot. Godspeed Mr Secretary General and the entire management in this task.

Finally, my piece last week about the enslavement of Kenyans in supporting foreign teams struck a good note with many. Prof. Makau Mutua tweeted the piece which then went viral.

A reader, S.W. Ndegwa said, “ Thankyou for your lovely column today 24/08/2020.”pride of a black man”.
I agree with you totally I am a Liverpool fan but my love for AFC leopards ‘ ingwe’ remains number one.”

"
Joseph Mboya,"I stayed with my great grandmother for a long time and what I remember most from this period is that I would be left behind at home alone, when my great grandmother would go to a far away shamba to harvest coffee with my aunties. My mum was a teenage mother, and she had left me under the care of my grandmother. I was six years old living in a Karatina village in Nyeri, and I believe God always sent his angels to watch over me.

After my nursery school, it was time to transit to Primary school, having attained the requirement of touching my ears. However, to my shock and disbelief, I could not be enrolled to class one since my mum was not there to produce my birth certificate.

It was a sad reality that I had to repeat nursery school for another year; the second year came and the same story played out once again. I remember my great grandmother even shedding tears trying to convince teachers to enroll me to no avail.

My auntie who was living in Kirinyaga got to hear of my tribulations and she sent one of her daughters to come for me. It was in Kirinyaga that I finally managed to join class one. As I lived with my aunt, and in keeping with the trend by her own children, I also started calling her mum, until she sat me down later and explained that she was not my maternal mother. She revealed to me the whereabouts of my real mother.

I was a typical village girl, I would fetch water after school, go to the shamba and sometimes even do casual work since life was not easy for us as my aunt  was raising six children. That she is an amazing woman was evident because out of the six of us, only two were her biological children.

However, God always provided and we never slept hungry.

At this time, I could not understand why my mum was not in my life. However hard I thought about it, I never got a clear answer, and this really affected me and most of the time when alone I would break down and cry.

My grandmother noticed this and she looked for my mother and convinced her to be coming home to visit me. By this time, my mum had another child, a sister. She came only twice when I was in primary school, the first time I was in class seven and the second time, after I had finished class eight. She wanted me to repeat class eight again, and having developed phobia of repeating classes, I refused.

It was with a lot of sadness that I learned that she was not ready to take me to high school and I had to start living my life from then on, knowing I was on my own. So I started looking for casual and house helps jobs and I hoped with time I will be able to go back to school.

This is how the miracle happened. I had come to Nairobi for some training in catering and home management and that’s when I learnt of the opportunity to attend part time tuition. By then I was a house girl in one of the homes in Nairobi. I divided my time in such a way that I could work during the week and on Sunday I would go to class from 8am- 5pm. After some years of doing this, I sat for my KCSE and it was a great achievement for me, an opportunity I still treasure to date.

After that, I still wanted to go further in life, so I looked for a school and enrolled for a diploma in Information Technology. I was still working as a house help. Once again, I would, wake up very early, prepare breakfast, clean the house and do laundry, then go to school from 10am. I would come back by 4pm make dinner, iron clothes, and study a bit before going to bed. I repeated this cycle until I graduated.

With my diploma, I managed to get a job in a reputable transport company and this year I transited to better and greener pastures at Gathuthiini Hope Foundation located in Kagio Town, Kirinyaga County.

I work with young people where I mentor and offer them hope.

My encouragement to young people out there is that’s God is the author of our life’s and His plans concerning our lives will prevail.  My life has been one crazy amazing journey and I know that God is not done with me yet.”

I am sure those from our generation who migrated (kwenda majuu, as we used to say) or those who left for the hereafter would be lost if they were to come back to the estates where they grew up; especially on that stretch of land starting from Ngara through Eastleigh to the areas generally referred to as Eastlando (Eastlands).

Few spirited individuals

Mathare slums has refused to change with the times and, although a few spirited individuals have tried their best to throw in a modern apartment block here and there, the ghetto we knew when we were young still stands strong, as if snarling, ‘gusa uone!’ (You dare touch me and see!)

Around here was a bar simply called ‘It is Here’. It was mainly patronised by folks from the lakeside and here you could listen to rhumba and benga to your fill. Further down the road was Gesarate Bar, which was mainly populated by the Abagusii. Here, you savoured their not-so-quiet storytelling skills.

In faraway Jamaica

For the young, we had our own Montego Bay, a distant imitation of the place with the same name in faraway Jamaica, better known for its reggae festivals. It was just a little patch of land with a stream fighting a losing battle with reeds. But we loved it.

It is in the same estate where an upstart by the name Pritchard Pouka Olang’ abandoned the SDA faith of his parents and told anyone who cared to listen that he would one day make it as a top musician. Somehow I believed him and was not in the least surprised when he stormed the Kenyan music scene as Poxxy Pressure.

My nostalgic drive took me through Eastlands proper and soon I was at City Stadium. Now, before the Moi International Sports Centre Kasarani, those of us who followed local football had only two venues – Nyayo Stadium and ‘Stadii’, which was City Stadium.

Many are the battles we fought with anti-riot police officers as we played hide and seek with the law keepers looking for an opportunity to jump over the fence into the stadium (kuruka stadii) without paying a single coin. I was later saved from this adventure when I became a boy scout and the key motivation was that I could now get – free of charge – into any stadium (again, another story for another day).

"
Joseph Mboya,"The straight shooting Kenyan scholar Professor Makau Mutua last week stirred a hornet’s nest with a hard-hitting piece calling out those Kenyans who slavishly follow European football in general and the English Premier League in particular.

In a no holds barred column that attracted a healthy dose of opprobrium in response especially on social media, Mutua rightfully called these people traitors.

“I have heard all kinds of excuses for this illicit, misbegotten, and contemptible love affair between Kenyans and the EPL. It’s the highest form of infidelity to Black pride. If Kenyans are going to “cheat” on Kenyan football, why can’t it be with South African, or even Senegalese, football? Or Nigerian football.

Must they cross the Sahara, leap over the Mediterranean, and go all the way to that little country called “Great” Britain?,” thundered the Distinguished Professor at the State University of New York’s Buffalo Law School.

I concur with the gentleman. And then some. With my oft repeated mantra, and in keeping with the parliamentary procedure of declaring interest, let me state this: as a youth I was a dyed-in-the-wool supporter of the European giants, Bayern Munich.

Like many of my generation, we were weaned on the “Football Made in Germany” that aired on our black and white TV sets every Saturday. Through that, names like that of the knock-kneed genius at goalkeeping, Toni Schumacher, and the legend himself Karl Heinz Rummenigge became part of our every day lingo.

But that was it and that was then. With time, I would cultivate my love for Gor Mahia better and just as the way the Bible warns us that even looking at a woman lustfully constitutes a sin, I consider it cheating of momentous proportions were I to support any other team.

The nearest I have been to these big teams is twice -- once in London when I shared a train ride with Arsenal supporters and another time in Naples when bad health stopped me from attending a Napoli vs Inter Milan night match.

What I admired about the Arsenal and Napoli supporters was the passion with which they followed their teams. Which is okay.

However, just like Mutua, I am always perplexed when I go online and see a Kenyan loving Manchester United and who cannot point Old Trafford on a map of England even if his life depended on it taunt an Arsenal fan, “we thumped you last week.”  

Not that the Arsenal loving Kenyans are any better. If anything, a good number of this lot has been known to look for the strongest rope with which to hang themselves when their team loses. What tomfoolery!

My pride as a black man cannot allow me to slave for teams where players sharing my pigmentation are called all manner of names including being shown banana peels and having monkey noises shouted at them.

I am a firm believer that we can develop our own football to the levels that we will not miss the European matches.

I have been there before. Back in early 1980s when I started going for local matches, the quality was up there.

Yes, there were teams like Liverpool and the aforementioned Bayern Munich calling the shots but that never stopped us from supporting -- and crying for -- Gor Mahia and AFC Leopards.

"
Joseph Mboya,"When Naomi Njoki came out of a government forced quarantine at the Kenya Medical Training College, she thought her troubles were over.

The 21-year old's optimism was buoyed by the fact that all the tests conducted at the facility had returned negative and that her quarantine was merely a matter of procedure as she had landed at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) from Italy.

As she would soon find out, her optimism was misplaced. She was now faced with a problem almost as big as having the disease itself- stigmatisation. People were avoiding her like the proverbial plague, making her sink into hopelessness.

Even her best friends stayed away and that rankled Naomi to no end. ""I felt like an animal when I came out of the quarantine and the whole world seemed to reject me. I was left wondering how the situation would have been had I been positive,"" she says.

That Covid-19 is a deadly pandemic is in no doubt. The disease has left the world's top scientists, political leaders, and the general population stunned.

Consequently, the government has been literally in our faces with the gospel of maintaining basic hygiene standards to beat the disease as they announce the daily corona roaster.

But what is yet to get enough exposure is the stigma of those who either test positive; or the ones whose family members are affected; or those coming out of quarantine facilities or self-isolation.

While stigma does not discriminate, many women have had to bear the brunt of the exclusion as their relationships are threatened or even destroyed. Neighbours turning against neighbours, family members against family members, and husbands against wives is the new normal as people try to navigate the uncharted waters of Covid-19.

For Nereah Wanjiku, 37, the coronavirus story begins after she suffered a major personal loss and traveled out of the country to try and recover.

She came back just when the government had announced the forced quarantine for returnees. After spending almost 20 days at a quarantine facility, she headed home optimistic that the worst had passed.

She was wrong. Her marriage that had not been the postcard of a perfect union, deteriorated further as her husband accused her of trying to kill him by bringing the virus home. This even though she had tested negative.

Confrontations became daily fare in their home as she slowly slipped into depression. Matters came to a boil one evening when the husband attempted to physically assault her after a quarrel. One of her sons, having had enough of the father's quarrels stood between the two parents and dared the father to lift a finger against the mother.

In anger the man told the son, ""I have always suspected you are not my son and today you have proved it."" Nereah says the look of pain in her son's face is one she will never forget. After that, the young man insisted on a DNA test and both father and son were tested. The results showed the husband as 99.7 percent of the biological father.

""I can see that their relationship is irredeemably broken and my son spends most of the time sitting alone and quiet. I don't know what is going through his mind and my attempts to have him see a counselor have been rejected,"" Nereah says.

In what is now referred to as the shadow pandemic, Gender-based violence has risen, as Covid-19 restricts people to their homes and cut out means of livelihoods.

Psychologist Gladys Mwiti says fissures in a marriage are fertile ground for perpetuating stigma. ""When people who have issues in their marriage find an opportunity to stigmatise the other partner they go ahead and do it,"" she says.

She points out that ignorance was a big factor in the stigma around the disease.

Bernice Wairimu has also experienced stigma from people she thought had her back.

When she came back home from Europe and was taken straight to a quarantine where she spent 40 days, her neighbours shunned her. ""I couldn't believe that my neighbours, people I had treated like family, who in the past often came to get gifts from abroad would now reject me,"" the 58-year-old says.

""Apart from my adult daughter who would pass by with my grandchildren, I was a lonely woman who cried her heart out each night. I did not understand why my neighbours and friends would turn their backs on me when I needed them the most. I felt unwanted and I had no one to share my problems with,"" she says.

""I only wish people would be more considerate even when one is positive. We should learn to love and embrace them because the stigmatisation they go through does not bode well for their recovery and general wellbeing,"" an emotional Bernice, says.

There was the sad case of Wangui Waweru from Nakuru who went through hell at the hands of family and neighbours after a Covid-19 scare. Wangui, a snail farmer later said her troubles began when she met with two clients in March. A short while later, two of the clients tested positive for the virus and were taken for quarantine at the Mbagathi Hospital in Nairobi.

""I had a meeting with my clients and after five days I realised that the two were isolated at Mbagathi. I became unwell developed a sore throat, I was vomiting, and was advised to self-isolate… I was in my house for weeks but I was still unwell, I called the hospital and they came for me with an ambulance,"" Wangui was quoted telling Citizen TV.

She stayed at the Nakuru Level 5 hospital and tests are done showed that she was free of the disease, but this did little to pacify her tormentors. To them, the fact that she went to the hospital was enough proof that she was infected. They began shunning her and even plotted to burn down her snail farm.

The stigma goes beyond social status if the treatment of the University of Nairobi don, Dr. Ken Ouko, widow, Grace, at his burial was anything to go by. The don succumbed to Covid-19 and overenthusiastic health workers from Homa Bay County ensured that she addressed the mourners while perched on the hearse inside the car, an act that drew widespread condemnation on the need to end stigma.

Consulting psychiatrist Dr. Alphonse Nabiswa of Aga Khan University Hospital says a lot of education is still needed around the disease. ""Most of the time people stigmatise out of the fear that they might contract the same disease. It also has a lot to do with ignorance. We need to tell people that those infected need our empathy and not ostracisation,"" he says.

Veteran journalists Argwings Odera and Mugo Theuri who covered HIV/Aids from its outbreak draw a parallel on discrimination on the two diseases. ""We are selling fear. The messages say Corona is a death sentence just like we did with HIV. This fuels stigma,"" Odera says.

Odera is the scribe who broke the story of Joe Muriuki the brave man who was the first Kenyan to go public with his HIV positive status.

Immediately the story ran, Odera says, life turned upside down for the Muriukis. ""I found the family isolated in their Umoja city council house. My news feature only helped to ratchet up their stigmatisation by people close to the family. Not long after my story, Jane, Mr. Muriuki's wife was forced out of her teaching job because parents did not want her near their children. Mr. Muriuki was also being pushed out of his city council job,"" Odera says.

Just like in the 1980s HIV/Aids pandemic, those infected with Coronavirus have to contend with stigma that can run right from the family, the society, and even the government.

Popular musician and radio presenter Gidi Gidi who recently tested positive for Covid-19 says that the support he received from his employer, friends, and family proved very crucial in his handling of the situation. He has since tested negative.

""What I have learnt with corona is that it's manageable. Let's stop the fear and stigma around it. Stigma is probably causing more harm to innocent lives. Stop those dramas during burials of COVID victims, it is just creating more fear for nothing. Let's demystify it, one can get through it within two weeks.... but let's protect the elderly and people with underlying conditions,"" the 'Unbwogable' hitmaker, says.

“I felt like an animal when I came out of quarantine and the whole world seemed to reject me. I had not even tested positive for Covid-19 and I was left wondering how the situation would have been had I been positive.

It still pains me to date that even a girl I considered my closest friend, someone I grew up with, told me on the phone that she could not come to see me because she feared I might infect her.

It was devastating.  Having been in Italy as the Covid-19 infections and deaths reached their zenith, I was too aware of the horrors of the disease and this continued playing on mind even as I was in the government imposed quarantine I had been forced into when I arrived back home.

As the situation deteriorated in Italy, I told my boyfriend and his family that I wanted to come back to Kenya, a request they agreed to. It was a tough decision considering that I had gotten a part time job even as I enrolled for my degree studies.

On leaving the isolation facility, I came face to face with stigma. Although my mom was welcoming, she nonetheless made life uncomfortable with her Covid-19 related jokes. I am sure she was well meaning but the jokes hurt still the same.

Trying to fit back into society was very hard. I remember having panic attacks which began in quarantine. I would feel myself running out of breath and would be convinced that I was infected.

You could not even cough in front of people lest you be judged to be Covid-19 positive. It was even worse if for some reason you felt nauseous and wanted to vomit.

I have forgiven all the people who shunned me because I want to concentrate on my future. My job offer in Italy is still open and I can’t risk staying in Kenya much longer because the employer might be forced to get someone readily available over there.

I believe soon we will get a vaccine or even a cure for this disease and people will not have to live in the current fear.”

Joseph Mboya,"Malawi’s new president Lazarus Chakwera is not a stranger in Kenya. In his distinguished academic life, the former Superintendent (Bishop) of the Assemblies of God of Malawi taught at the church’s Global University, which is domiciled at the Buru Buru-based East African School of Theology (EAST).

Here, Mr Chakwera – who took over from Mr Peter Mutharika last week after a repeat presidential election ordered by the court – lectured at master’s level, teaching many Kenyans in the process.

“Yes, he is well known around the church circles here. In fact, if you next meet him, ask him about Buru Buru,” says Pastor Edward Munene of the International Christian Centre, Mombasa, an Assemblies of God congregation.

Mr Chakwera has been a commencement speaker at the Kitengela-based Kenya Assemblies of God University and was the guest speaker when Bishop Peter Njiiri was named the chancellor of the university.

In addition, Mr Chakwera has supervised many Kenyans when he was   in charge of PhD at the Pan African Theology School (PATHS) based at the West Africa School of Advanced Theology in Lome, Togo.

The Rev Leo Kinuthia, who is currently pursuing his doctorate at PATHS, says of Mr Chakwera: “He is a transparent and transformational leader. These are necessary attributes which he will need as president because now he will be leading both Christians and non-Christians alike,” says Rev Kinuthia, who serves at the International Christian Centre, Nairobi, another Assemblies of God congregation.

Pastor Munene recalls his meeting with Mr Chakwera: “I met Rev Lazarus Chakwera at a consultative forum where we were discussing how to reach Africa with the gospel message. I loved his sermon and the challenge he gave us to lay down our lives for the sake of transforming the continent. He was the General Superintendent (Bishop) of the Malawi Assemblies of God at that time. His humility and wisdom inspired me greatly.”

The pastor said he was excited to see a fellow clergyman stepping into this new role. “I commit to pray for him. I believe he will lead this nation as a leader of integrity.”

In this Kenyan connection, Mr Chakwera joins a club of people who have lived or worked in Kenya and later rose to be presidents in their own countries. The list includes Ms Ellen Johnson Sirleaf of Liberia, who once narrated how she used to buy second-hand clothes in Kibera’s Toi Market.

She was President of Liberia between 2006 and 2018. Uganda’s president Yoweri Museveni has also previously talked about his life in Nairobi before he became President.

One of Mr Chakwera’s predecessors, Dr Joyce Banda, was a young woman living in Nairobi when the political bug bit her, and which later catapulted her to be the president of Malawi from 2012 to 2014. As a guest speaker when Kenya celebrated its 50th year of Independence on December 12, 2013, Ms Banda, greeted the crowd at Nairobi’s Nyayo National Stadium in fluent Kiswahili — declaring she was also a mwananchi (citizen).

She revealed how she came to Kenya in 1975 and lived in Nairobi’s Kileleshwa Estate.

“I want to say thank you to Kenya because this country had a lot of influence on my life and whatever I have achieved started from here,” said Ms Banda, who was replaced by Mr Mutharika in 2014.

Mr Chakwera also had a precedent in Kenya to thank for his victory when the High Court in Malawi, when ruling in an election petition in his favour, cited the 2017 presidential election petition filed by opposition leader Raila Odinga against President Uhuru Kenyatta.

"
Joseph Mboya,"“I was born in Kariobangi in Nairobi’s Eastlands. My father was a Muslim Somali and my mother, a Kikuyu from Thika. I am the sixth born in a family of ten children. My mother was later to convert into Islam and we were all raised as practicing Muslims.

From a very young age, I loved praying and going for Madrasa. I was very prayerful and I would even lead prayers. I loved God.

However, this did not sit well with my father and one day, he sat me down and told me that what I was doing was haram in Islam because in that culture, girls and women are not supposed to do so.

I don’t even know how to start the story of my life because it is one that is full of pain and perilous episodes. Growing up, I was a very reserved girl, I loved my space and was very careful with my own life. I just loved my space. I was also very naïve.

I finished my secondary school at 17 and immediately joined a college in the city. However, my college journey was never completed and I ended up getting married at a young age.

There was this young man who was a friend to my brother-in-law. He was a Somali from Mandera. There was a day I went to visit my sister and he saw me and apparently he was love struck. Before long, he approached my father and requested that he marries me.

My father was a man who brooked no dissent and one day when I came back from college he informed me that I would be getting married soon.

I did not understand why my father had come to this decision yet I was still in college. Forget about the fact that I did not even know who my husband to be was. This is the way of my dad’s people and I had to obey. I was naïve and still a virgin.

I came to meet the man later and he introduced himself. He was a police officer. We got married and soon we had our first born, a son. Unfortunately, our second born, a daughter died soon after that.

At the tender age of 23 my husband passed on after an illness and I became a brand new widow. Confused, jobless and with nowhere to turn to, I packed my meagre earthly possessions and went back to my parents’ house in Kariobangi estate, Nairobi.

A year after moving back to Kariobangi, I fell very ill. The doctors diagnosed me with a terminal illness. The next five years of my life was all about battling illness. I thought I was going to die. I started asking questions, why me? At one time I was admitted to hospital after suffering another bout of sickness. I reflected on my life and realised that all the lofty dreams I had had come crashing.

I therefore decided to end it all by committing suicide. In my thinking, this was going to end all my miseries because dead people feel no pain. Then a strange thing happened. Just as I was finishing my plans on how to end my life, a nurse by the name Jane came to my bed and gave me a cassette player and told me to listen to a certain tape.

It was a story of a lady called Catherine Backstar. Jane also gave me a book written by Catherine titled “Prepare to meet your God.”

The book was talking about eternal life. It was talking about hell. With the benefit of hindsight, I can now say that God knew I was also tired of living but once I had heard the tape and read the book, I started refocusing on life and fighting to live. God used Jane to make me realise the importance of staying alive.

Then there was Sophie another nurse at a nursing home in Mathare slums. Sophie sacrificed so much. She decided to take care of me. She took care of my bills and told me never to worry, and that whenever I fell sick all I needed to do was to go to the nursing home, or call her to send somebody to pick me from home.

She would discharge me after any admissions and drive with me to the supermarket where she would buy me food and other basic requirements.

I would spend months on end in hospital, but she would never stop taking care of me. She was simply an angel from God. By this time, I had become a Christian and I depended on God, I told myself I was going to hold on to Jesus and believe in God. So I began praying.

And all of a sudden, the thoughts of death disappeared and I resolved to not die. I started to believe in life. I said I want to live and declare the goodness of the Lord. I felt better.

With the new lease of life, I knew I had to start all over again because I had been given a second chance. Although I was doing well health-wise, deep down I had a longing for someone to share my life with.

I prayed for a good man in my life. I needed somebody I could rely on and a shoulder to cry and lie on. I needed a man I could come home to and share my experiences and get support from and pray together, a loving man who would not judge me but accept me for who I am.

My prayers were answered and in April of this year I got married to my husband Bishop Hoseah Mbugua.

Meanwhile, my baby who I have traveled this journey with, Idris Ibrahim, is now a lawyer practicing in Nairobi.”

"
Joseph Mboya,"I first met Raphael Ndingi Mwana a’ Nzeki, the then archbishop of Nairobi, some time in 1999 as a member of a newly formed fellowship of Christian journalists.

Our group was affiliated to Gegrapha, a global fellowship of scribes. Gegrapha finds its roots in the gospel of John 19:22. It is Greek for “what I have written, I have written” which was Pontius Pilate’s response to Jewish chief priests who complained when he wrote ‘King of Jews’ on Jesus’s cross.

With veteran journalist Connie Kisuke (now a media lecturer at Daystar University) as our leader, we explained all this to an attentive Ndingi.

The meeting itself was a miracle of sorts. In forming the group, one of our objectives was to advise church leaders on how to deal with the media.

Our efforts to reach out to the men and women of the cloth were not met with the expected reciprocal enthusiasm … until we knocked on Ndingi’s doors.

A keen listener, Ndingi gave us a hearing and, at the end of it all, gave us a room free of charge to be using as an office at the Holy Family Basilica.

Meeting Ndingi face-to-face was an awesome experience because of the name the man had carved for himself in fighting for the rights of the downtrodden.

In my estimation, he fell in the same category with the then legendary Archbishop of Manila, he of the rather strange-sounding name of Jaime Cardinal Sin.

As Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos and his thieving clan wreaked havoc in the country, it was Cardinal Sin who became the moral compass of the nation, calling out the dictator and his equally distasteful wife Imelda Romualdez Marcos for their excesses and extravagant lifestyle. It was said that Imelda owned a wardrobe of some 1,220 pairs of shoes, earning her the nickname ‘Marie Antoinette, with shoes.’ But I digress.

Back to Ndingi. Many agree that, whereas he had served with distinction at the Diocese of Machakos, it was at the Nakuru Diocese that he was catapulted to the national limelight. Initially, Ndingi was seen as a quiet critic of President Daniel arap Moi’s administration.

"
Joseph Mboya,"With the country under a one-party rule, brave church leaders effectively kept the government in check. Ndingi was one of them and his stinging criticisms of the Kanu regime often reflected the views of his flock.

The apogee of Ndingi’s tour of duty in Nakuru was when some Kanu stalwarts, in a diabolical scheme to prove Moi’s “prophecy” that reintroduction of multipartyism would lead to civil strife, sponsored the now infamous tribal clashes in the Rift Valley that saw more than 2,000 people – mainly Kikuyus perceived to be opposition sympathisers – killed and thousands others displaced.

As these heinous crimes were taking place, the top brass of the Rift Valley provincial administration led by the Provincial Commissioner Zachary Ogongo, a man of quiet disposition who, when in a business suit, cut the image of someone who had spent a lifetime working in a bank and was never promoted, chose to look at the events with rose-tinted glasses, telling the world that all was well.

That’s when Ndingi unsheathed his claws, showing that there was more fight in the man than the diminutive body suggested.

At the height of the clashes in April 1992, Ndingi made the startling claim that unidentified lorries and helicopters were ferrying unknown people into Rikia Forest in Molo, the epicentre of the fighting.

He wondered why locals had been denied access to the forest while a civic leader regularly went there late at night. In a scripted response that the itching ears of his bosses wanted to hear, The PC denied the allegations, calling Ndingi a liar.

Ogongo claimed that the helicopter Ndingi was referring to had carried provincial security committee members on a mission to “assess destruction in the forests”.

In the ensuing falling-out, Ndingi’s fellow bishops came to his defence, with 21 of them, meeting under the aegis of the Kenya Episcopal Conference, said he was saying the truth and demanded an apology from the PC. President Moi waded into the controversy, defending Ogongo. The PC was later to apologise to Ndingi.

In 1996, Ndingi was named Coadjutor of the Archdiocese of Nairobi to serve under Maurice Cardinal Otunga, thus coming back to the same place where he started off on being ordained as a priest in 1961 after finishing his studies at Kiserian Seminary. In 1997, he succeeded Otunga.

The high profile of the Nairobi position made Ndingi more or less the head of the Catholic church. Many remember the fierce fight he waged against the distribution of condoms by health workers.

“The Catholic Church does not advocate the use of condoms under any circumstances. HIV/Aids grows so fast because of availability of condoms. When you give a young Kenyan a condom, for him or her it’s a licence for promiscuity. They think they’re protected. They’re not protected,” Ndingi often said.

Unbeknown to many of his detractors, Ndingi was actually stating the Catholic church’s official stance on condoms.

The debate later died but Ndingi earned the moniker ‘kondoom’ because of the way he pronounced the word. Ndingi was also to face some disquiet from within his church and a section of Kenyans when he accepted a gift of a brand new Mercedes Benz car, a gift from monied Central Kenya Catholic politicians.

Ndingi retired on October 6, 2007, marking the end of an illustrious career for the man who was born in Mwala, Machakos County on Christmas Day of 1931.

Till we meet at Jesus’s feet, man of God.

"
Joseph Mboya,"A sudden illness on Tuesday night transformed me from a storyteller to being the story.

It started with my friend developing joint aches, which escalated to a serious headache. My suggestion that we seek medical attention was dismissed outright.

As the situation deteriorated, the nightmare began. Could it be Covid-19? I didn’t want to contemplate.

Since I was the ‘healthy’ one, I had to calm the fraying nerves. “No, you don’t have corona. I think it’s just a normal fever,” I declared, although from the laughter that greeted my declaration it was clear my attempt at raising optimism had failed.

Then came another problem: it was past 7pm and the dusk-to-dawn curfew was in effect. I started mental mapping of the nearest hospital accessible from Imara Daima.

My best bet was South B or Nairobi West. In the worst case scenario, I could try Nairobi Hospital, Coptic or Aga Khan. My patient was showing alarming signs of weakness.

I took the matter into my hands. I called my place of work, asked for the staff clinic and found a cheery gentleman on the line.

I explained the nature of emergency facing me and the man was very sympathetic. Unfortunately, he could not send an ambulance.

He advised me to carry my staff identity card on my way to the hospital and call him if I ran into the police. He would talk to them.

He assured me that the police were under orders to treat such cases sympathetically.

Now, if there’s one lesson my 30 years of practising journalism has taught me, it’s this; orders tend to disappear somewhere along the chain of command and the officer on the beat is usually free to use their discretion, nearly always with disastrous outcomes for those they come into contact with.

I had the option of using my press card but this would have involved a bit of inveigling in explaining the case of my patient, who was stretched out on the back seat. We said a short prayer and hit the road.

The Nairobi I saw on Tuesday night was totally different from the city I have known since my early teenage years. Easing into Mombasa Road felt like driving in another planet.

"
Joseph Mboya,"The road is normally busy at this time of the night with workers heading back home, taxis racing their fares to Jomo Kenyatta International Airport to catch flights, while, in the air, the huge planes approaching for landing normally fly so low you almost see those on board.

Not on this night. The road was deserted and, for a moment or two, I was transported to the pages of the popular Christian fiction books Left Behind by Tim LaHaye and Jerry B Jenkins, which describe life on earth after the rapture promised by the Bible has taken place.

As I approached the Kenya Railways bridge, just before General Motors, I saw a traffic policeman stopping a G4S van.

My patient murmured a quiet and fast prayer that we wouldn’t be stopped. The prayers worked and I once again had the entire road all to myself.

I fought the temptation to gun down the car because, although my patient would not admit it, I knew the situation was getting worse.

I remembered road crash statistics and was grimly reminded that accidents had caused more deaths on our roads than headaches.

I took the turn into South B and was greeted by more shock. You see, the area stretching from South B through South C and to Nairobi West has been my stomping ground and is one corner of our globe that rarely goes to sleep, not this early.

Driving into Mariakani Cottage Hospital, I found a group of friendly watchmen who were more than willing to direct me to the parking.

We ambled into the casualty and found the place empty. A friendly nurse took us through the paces of registration and directing my patient to the doctor.

The dreaded moment was finally here. What the doctor would find out had the potential of changing both our lives in ways we couldn’t even imagine: if he had recommended the patient for a Covid-19 test based on the lab analysis, mandatory quarantine would follow.

Since I had been the one handling the patient, the same fate awaited me.

Subconsciously, I replayed the figures Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe had been doling out in his briefings.

My mind wandered to Italy, Spain, the US and the other places the virus had ravaged. With massive effort, I blocked out such thoughts and focused on getting favourable results.

As I sat there, a man walked in with his daughter who looked seriously ill. From their dusty feet, it was evident that they had done some serious hoofing before getting to the hospital.

My patient came out with a smile that could light up a Christmas tree. It was an all-clear from the doctor. Turns out it was a case of bacterial infection.

There was no need for further tests. We hugged and back-slapped one another. I don’t think a bacterial infection had ever been celebrated that much since God created the earth.

The trip back home was easier and faster. Just as we had made a pact with God as we left home, we said a prayer of thanksgiving; thanking God for having the means of getting to hospital, for medical facilities that are near, doctors and nurses to man them and even the ability to pay for the services offered.

We also remembered to pray for the nameless man we had left at the reception waiting to hear from the doctor on the fate of his daughter.

"
Joseph Mboya,"Prof Rose Ruto, a lecturer at Moi University, has been elected chair of the African chapter of the Commonwealth Open Schooling Association (COMOSA). Higher Education interviewed her on the role and what aspired to achieve such a feat.

How does it feel being elected chair?

I feel honoured and privileged to get an opportunity to serve in the African continent. I understand that this is a position of responsibility and a quest to have an impact on society, and so I have these mixed feelings. I am extremely excited because I believe that I will create an impact in open schooling initiatives in Kenya and Africa but also eager about at the expectations, given the vastness of African continent.

What motivated you to contest?

Creating hope and opportunities for everyone through schooling propelled my desire to contest. You see, UNESCO records that we had 258 million out of school youth and children by October 2019. My heart breaks whenever I see children and youth, whose opportunities in life are ruined because they missed to get an education to allow them to thrive. They too should have a chance in life through education.

I also know that a good education supports sustainable individuals, communities, and nations to thrive. World peace depends on each and every person having equitable access resources, foremost being a good education. My desire is to use my education and skills to serve COMOSA, for the sake of those excluded from learning and schooling.

What were some of the challenges you faced in the race and how did you overcome them?

One of the challenges was the vast African continent and getting to reach the voters across the different countries of Africa. Secondly, being in the director of open and distance learning at Moi University, I understand the issues in the area. I was also bold, as some voters later told me, because I went fishing in an ocean, like a fisherman casting his net far and wide. I also leveraged on my networks and contacts in South Africa, where I did my doctoral studies. I also got networks from other parts of Africa, and of course in East Africa and locally. Technology is an enabler, networking, and social media are powerful tools to overcome any distance or resource barrier. That is what I will also leverage on to support my work in COMOSA.

What or who was your inspiration growing up and how has it impacted your education journey?

Tragedies that befell my parents and husband inspired me to greatness.

Looking back, I think my late father had a premonition he was going to die. During school opening dates, he would go to school, pay fees, and return home to nudge us to go to school. Remember these were those days when fee was paid in cash.

So, on this particular opening day, he came back after paying my school fees at St. Joseph's Girls - Chepterit, where I did my O-levels. The bus stop overlooked our farm, and as I waited for the bus to go to school, he arrived to bid me goodbye. It is one episodic moment in my life, whose events are so clear as if it happened only yesterday.

This was the day my father injected his vision for me, for my future and my life. As he talked to me, he said: 'Listen, I want you to read until you 'finish education'. I know you are a very intelligent girl, my girl. Be assured that I will not lack fees."" That was our last conversation, because he passed on in July of that year, and I did my Form Four examinations amid tears and emotional pain.

But I passed, with a Division One. I knew he had meant every word because on occasion, among 18 'children, I would be the only one to receive my Christmas dress in August. How special. My father had injected his vision of my life to me and to my elder brother David, who at only 21 years when my dad passed on, was left to carry the family forth in supporting my mother. Henceforth, even though he was gone, I had no doubt what he wanted for me and my life. I always encourage parents to breathe life to their children, and to articulate their wishes for them.

I joined Moi Girls High School Eldoret in 1986 for 'A' levels and other miracles happened. Fr. George Cheboryot, who I had just met shortly before my father died, came in to support me. He supported and inspired my excellence. At Moi Girls, the principal, Mrs Hellen Cheramboss, was my inspiration. I later enrolled at Moi University in 1988 for a Bachelor of Education and a Masters' degree in Educational Psychology in 1992.

This gave me a solid foundation for my doctoral studies at the University of Pretoria in South Africa in 2006, where I also met two wonderful supervisors, Prof Irma Eloff and Carien Lubbe De Beer.

The other inspiration was the tragedy that befell my husband which made me abandon my PhD studies at Kenyatta University. One year into it (the course), my husband and children were involved in a terrible road accident on August 17th, 2003. My children survived with minor injuries, but my husband slipped into a coma.

He was to be gone for close to three months. When he woke up, he had forgotten how to walk, eat and all the basic self-care that we usually take for granted. He was admitted at Nairobi Hospital, and I literally lived in hospital, and later took some leave to rehabilitate him. But as someone says, you never know how strong you are, until being strong is the only choice you have.

It was like starting life all over for the husband including feeding on a baby bottle? Imagine lifting an adult's legs, and literally reminding them how legs move? This is what I did for my husband. Family, friends, and of course Moi University helped me carry the burden, and I am eternally grateful.

"
Joseph Mboya,"Describe to us your organisation and its workings?

COMOSA which stands for Commonwealth of Learning Open Schooling Association (COMOSA), is an affiliate of the Commonwealth of Learning (COL). COMOSA consists of any individual or organisation which subscribes to open schooling initiatives.

Open Schooling Initiatives (OIS) is a framework used to ensure that those who would not otherwise fit into the 'formal schools' can still get a chance to learn, currently possible through technology enabled learning. COMOSA is organised into Chapters, which are headed by elected by Chairs.

Currently there are Four Chapters; Africa, Asia, Pacific and Caribbean/Canada. I head the Africa Chapter. Comosaconnect is the communication arm of COMOSA and COL coordinates it.

Talking to you one gets the impression that you are passionate about availing education in ways other than the conventional ones. Kindly elaborate

UNESCO Information Paper No. 61 October 2019 put the number of out-of-school children and youth in the world at 258 million. Overall, the largest youth population is in Africa. This is both an opportunity and a challenge. The government has initiatives for technology enhanced learning like connecting schools to the Internet, use of radio or TV lessons. These are variants of open and distant learning.

The same initiatives should be extended to villages, with innovations that work with solar, and with little internet. We are living during the fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR), and already the government has a draft 'Digital Economy Blueprint'. Every other African country needs to prioritise digital skills for children and youth, as most of the world youth live in Africa. It would be sad to leave children, and youth behind, as these are the drivers of the 4IR.

Yes, currently, there are many organisations that are now offering courses for free. For example, Coursera, an online education provider is running courses for free. Anybody can enrol for those courses and get a qualification. Technology enhanced learning promises to make education accessible, in ways we have never experienced before.

During my term, I plan to lobby governments to adopt technology, especially to make learning accessible to learners excluded from formal school systems.

What is the one new idea that you are bringing on board?

A problem-based approach to service and lobbying beyond the necessary slogan of getting everyone to learn. I want to anchor my vision on community service, engagement, and sustainable and peaceful communities. I want to lobby national and county governments and individuals to make investments in technology to support communities.

What are your future plans?

I will continue to serve my community, students and invest in personal development. I plan to start a charity to reach out to out-of-school children.

There have been concerns that we have concentrated so much on addressing the plight of girls at the expense of boys, how would you work to achieve a balance?

Every stakeholder should understand that both boys and girls are children. In fact, there is need to develop boys to men, so that we have stronger families and a stronger nation.

Marriages are breaking because there is role confusion, where empowered-women are not prepared to play within the space of empowerment, while men do not know how to handle empowered women. A lot of education, and proper socialisation is important to create the balance.

"
Joseph Mboya,"Over the years, I have never belonged to any of the Gor Mahia's branches.

But I have, by association, played a role in most of the club's branches.

I do remember joining the Facebook branch at the Nyayo National Stadium for a fundraiser to purchase a bus for the club.

I also engaged in the ""Adopt a Player"" project in which we raised money to have the playing unit fly to Mombasa to play against Bandari.

Being a community club, branches have formed a solid backbone for the club especially during the trying times when the team needs support. It is a practice worldwide, a perfect example is Barcelona that has thousands of members and also groupings akin to what we have here as branches.

Apart from offering support during matches, branches have been able to raise money to meet the needs of the team and also to host the players when they travel to different parts of the country.

I am told the Gor Mahia has more than 500 registered branches countrywide, some are actively involved in supporting the club while others are more or less groupings of fans who come together as self-help groups in the name of the club.

Before the coming of the Facebook Branch, Away, Magufuli or the Lupita branches, there were the branches which were associated with estates. For instance, South B or South C would have their own branches. There were also Kaloleni and Makongeni branches in Nairobi, Baxton branch in Mombasa and many others.

"
Joseph Mboya,"But today, I want to focus on a new branch that has come up with a totally new way of how branches should operate- The Kulundeng Original.

Last week I met a Gor Mahia fan by the name of Simple Bob, his real name is Collins Otieno. Simple Bob is the coordinator of the Kulundeng' Original.

How they came up with the name Kulundeng' is a story for another day. Kulundeng' is a colourful beetle that as kids we used to tie a string on its hind leg and let it fly.

Now, Kulundeng' Original has already managed to attract more than 50 registered and 1000 non registered members countrywide.

There is also Gor Mahia Augmentin who came up with a fund to raise money and pay players winning bonuses.

These two groups are made up of young Gor Mahia fans who are focused in not only funding the club but also building capacity amongst themselves and networks through football.

Kulundeng' and Augmentin have within itself a business model for the members development and a social model where they bring together Gor Mahia fans and share ideas on how to source for sponsorship for the club.

As I said over the years we have had branches at the club, some have been identified with hooliganism and indiscipline, but Kulundeng' and Augmentin is showing a different way how we should work with the club.

I implore the K'Ogalo nation branches to borrow a leaf from Kulundeng' and Augmentin and come together to help build the club at these trying times.

Finally, I join Gor Mahia officials, players and fans to send my condolences to the family of Patrick Osewe who passed on last week. Osewe was the driver of the Gor Mahia team bus. May his soul rest in eternal peace.

"
Joseph Mboya,"As the regular writer of this column Tom Osanjo said in his last week's column, the coronavirus has really changed the way we do sports, not only in Kenya but worldwide. In all the countries of the world, sports authorities are scratching their heads trying to find solutions.

Already the world popular English Premier League is in abeyance, the famous Monaco Grand Prix is closed for the first time in over a century and so on.

Individually, players are affected, clubs on lockdown mode and the bean counters talking of the virus cost running into billions of dollars.

It was with much interest that many of us who follow local football rushed to check on the news that the local football mandarins were looking for ways of solving the impasse in the Kenyan Premier League with the coronavirus threat looming large.

Two things are at stake here. First is the issue of the matches that were not played as the affected teams stayed away from stadiums in adhering to a directive by the government that people stay away from crowded places to help fight against the disease.

The second issue is the fate of the league which hangs in the balance over the same virus.

Kenyan Premier League champions Gor Mahia failed to honour their Betway Cup match against Posta Rangers at Afraha stadium while Bandari's match against Sofapaka programmed to be played at Mbaraki Stadium in Mombasa did not materialise.

KCB cancelled their encounter against money bags Wazito at Afraha Stadium, while Keroka Technical also failed to travel to Moi Stadium in Kisumu for their Cup tie against Kisumu All Stars.

"
Joseph Mboya,"Although the Bandari-Sofapaka match failed to take off on a technicality -- the small issue of whether the match should have started at 2pm or 4pm being the bone of contention.

However, on their part, our beloved Gor Mahia has written to the football authorities explaining why they did not take to the pitch. I stand with the club's position.

However, even before FKF could act on the same, the Sports Dispute Tribunal came to town with their landmark ruling against the current FKF office holders.

The same ruling also disbanded the federation's National Executive Committee. My advice is simple. Let us abide by the government's order and not punish the clubs that acted responsibly by not playing. Such clubs should be commended and not condemned.

Tied to this has been the debate on what to do with deciding the league winners if the coronavirus threat extends to when the league is supposed to end.

One of the proposals put forward is a knock-out tournament featuring the top teams from which the winner will be crowned the league champions.

My take: this is a waste of time and money. Just declare Gor Mahia the 2020 league champions.

Tom Osanjo's writing resumes next week

"
Joseph Mboya,"The Kenyan Scouts chapter will continue honouring the memory of the movement’s founder, Lord Baden-Powell, who has been accused of racism by Black Lives Matter protesters in Britain, leading to the removal of his statue in Dorset.

Saying that he could “only speak of the rich values that Mr Powell taught us through the scouting movement”,  Mr Anthony Gitonga, the international commissioner at the Kenya Scouts Movement, said the founder will remain a hero in Kenya, the protests notwithstanding.

Baden-Powell’s monument in Poole Quay, Dorset, has come up on a website detailing potential targets for anti-racism protesters. He was a lieutenant in the British army specialising in reconnaissance and scouting, and upon retirement moved to Nyeri, where he started the Scouts Movement in 1910.

He died in 1941 and was buried in Nyeri town, where he had relocated permanently three years earlier. His wife Olave Powell is buried next to him.

But with the wave of protests over the May 25 death of George Floyd, an African American, while in police custody in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Powell’s dark past is being re-examined. Besides being the founder of the worlds’ largest youth movement with a following of over 50 million people, he is accused of homophobia, racism and being a supporter of Adolf Hitler.

Authorities have been forced to offer 24-hour security for his statue, which British media said was next in line in a new wave of destruction targeting statues of people believed to have aided the suppression of black people.

The Black Lives Matter movement has gained momentum after Floyd’s death, sweeping across his native US and other parts of the world. This week protesters in Bristol, UK, dumped into the sea the statue of Edward Colson, a 17th century slave trader. The Guardian newspaper reported that Baden-Powell’s statue was among those added to a growing “hit list” of nearly 80 across the UK. It added that some local residents, including former scouts, rushed to the defence of the statue.

There were reports of a planned demolition of British war-time Premier Winston Churchill’s statue in Prague, Czech Republic. The 3.5-metre statue has already been sprayed with red graffiti reading “Byl rasista” (“He was racist”) and “Black Lives Matter”. The graffiti was later removed using a high-pressure washer.

The Mirror quoted Councillor Mark Howell, deputy leader of Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council, describing Baden-Powell’s statue as “much-loved” and said it had been at risk of damage or destruction.

“We know that local people feel proud of Lord Baden-Powell’s and the Scout movement’s links with Poole, and that some people feel that we would be giving in to the protesters by temporarily removing the statue,” he said.

Baden-Powell has a rich history in Nyeri and his grave continues to be a tourist attraction, and the burial and respects paid to him and colonial soldiers show the regard in which whites are held, even in death.

While Baden-Powell, his wife Olave and colonial soldiers’ graves are well kept, thousands of massacred Kenyan freedom fighters are buried in unmarked mass graves across Nyeri County. The Kenya Scouts Movement has been pushing to have Unesco declare Powell’s grave a World Heritage Site.

The Nyeri War Cemetery hosts 368 graves for Commonwealth soldiers who died in World War I, and war casualties who succumbed at the British military hospital or at the one used by Italian prisoners of war.

At the site, it takes a keen eye to notice the neat rows of headstones are arranged according to nationality. The grass, perfectly trimmed fence and beautiful flowers are a sight to behold. One would be forgiven for mistaking it for a picnic site.

Barely 500 metres away is a Mau Mau mass grave, where hundreds of Kenyans executed by the British colonialists were buried. Because the cemetery is unmarked, the Kiawara slum keeps encroaching on it. Tens of other mass graves have over the years been discovered in Tetu, Othaya, Mukurweini and Kieni.

Historian Anthony Maina termed the situation “a big shame to Kenya”.

“History will judge us harshly because we failed to honour those who fought for our freedom.”

Joseph Mboya,"New Gor Mahia striker Benson Ochieng Oluoch, popularly known as Benson Omala, says he is still over the moon after he was named among the reserves by Harambee Stars head coach Francis Kimanzi.

Ochieng, 18, is among the six players included in the reserve list for the upcoming friendly against Zambia set to be played on October 13 at the Nyayo National Stadium.

The former Western Stima ace could get the nod to join the main team sooner as the Football Kenya Federation (FKF) continue to grapple with the dilemma whether star striker Michael Olunga, who plies his trade with Kashiwa Reysol in Japan, will be available.

Other players whose availability is in doubt are captain Victor Wanyama who plays for Montreal Impact in Canada, Johanna Omolo who turns out for Cercle Brugge in Belgium and experienced goalkeeper Arnold Origi - who based in Finland and plays for top-tier club HIFK.

Oluoch, who joined Gor Mahia recently from Western Stima, says he is happy with the call-up and ready to serve the nation.

""I am overjoyed. To be included in the reserve squad of the national team is good recognition in itself. I am still very young and the call-up, therefore, means the technical bench recognises my ability and that is very satisfying and fulfilling at the same time,"" Omala said.

Omala is inspired by Olunga but is quick to point out that he is also a good striker by his own standards.
Olunga finished the 2015 Kenyan Premier League (KPL) season as the club’s top scorer with 19 goals and he moved to Swedish giants Djurgardens the following year.

He would later move to Chinese moneybags Guizhou Zhicheng and had short stint at Spanish side Girona. This is the sort of trajectory Oluoch is eager to follow in his career.

""He (Olunga) did very well locally and has continued to shine in every league he has played in abroad and that is exactly the same career progress I want for myself. He has inspired me and I hope to achieve what he has done or more,"" Oluoch said.

""I know I am a good striker too and I have the potential to do even better. I might be young but I believe I am the next best striker to come out of Kenya,"" he confidently added.

Omala gained recognition while featuring for Kisumu-based Manyatta United in the Chapa Dimba na Safaricom Tournament in 2019 where he emerged as the Nyanza region top scorer as well as the nationals top scorer.

He would then join KPL-side Western Stima where his star continued shining and he became the youngest player to win the Sports Journalist Association of Kenya (SJAK) player of the month for his outstanding performance in December 2019.

The national team is expected to hit camp from Saturday and Omala remains optimistic that he will be among those that start preparations for the international friendly match against Zambia.
