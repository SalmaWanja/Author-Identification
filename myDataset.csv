Abigail Arunga,"Next week, the government is finally calling for the views of Kenya on the Huduma Bill, conducting a public participation forum at the Kenya School of Government (far enough for people who don’t care enough to not come) on July 31 (mid-week for working Kenyans, who are not likely to take a morning off) from 9 am. This bill that they want to pass will basically make you a criminal for doing anything without a Huduma Namba – and that is not an exaggeration. It’s almost as if the government is redefining what it means to be a citizen by the card, instead of by birth.

The Daily Nation has previously stated that ''The Huduma card shall serve as the official government-issued document for identification and conduct of transactions. This means that you will be required to have Huduma Namba to register as a voter, access universal healthcare, passport, apply for a driving licence, register a mobile phone number, pay taxes, transact in the financial markets and open a bank account.''

LINKING

The thing is, even though Kenyans were doing all of these things before, we weren’t doing it in a way that is controlled by a central (unguided) database. Even though when you key in your KRA pin, it automatically links to your email address, ID number, phone number, etc. – as does our new driver’s licenses with chips in them, and our passports – but apparently that isn’t enough linking. Apparently we need to once again link our information in another new system that will beat anything we have had before, ignoring the fact that the only things our current systems have managed to beat is a record for inefficiency. For some reason, we are to believe that this new dispensation will somehow offer a whole new world to us, while being run by the same people, with the same computers, in the same companies. But we’ll be made to pay for it again, I am sure, in a bold new budget that makes sure we pay for our debt to China with a whole country 14 times over.

CONSENT

Though the government claims that our information is intact, scandals like Cambridge Analytica and Safaricom’s recent hack spree prove otherwise. Should Kenyans even care if our data is private, if we are willingly on Facebook and Face App anyway? Yes. Yes, we should. Because consent was involved in signing up for Facebook – unlike this card and number being shoved down our throats (also, who asked for a Master Card link? And why Master Card?). And, let’s not forget that the High Court already said that registration was not mandatory: ‘In March this year, the High Court ruled that Huduma Namba registration should be voluntary and no one should be denied services. The government from February to May this year, undertook a voluntary Huduma Namba registration, netting about 35 million Kenyans.’ But denying services is exactly what they are trying to do.

It has been said that among the things that people without Huduma Namba will miss out on include registering marriages, registering for electricity connection and enrolling in public educational facilities. Most Kenyans don’t register their marriages anyway, seeing as most marriages in Kenya are customary. A lot of houses don’t have electrification in the first place, much less need to enlist for it – perhaps if the government fulfilled that promise, then there would be a need for this threat. Enrolling in educational facilities almost seems pointless if you’re not in a major city, town centre or somewhere a former president built a school – because educational resources are not evenly distributed, the curriculum hasn’t been figured out and teachers are working on less than bare minimum, which leads to many teachers doing less than the bare minimum.

PENALTIES

People who seek services without the number will be jailed for one year or pay a fine of Sh1 million. For getting services from a government that is supposed to be for Kenyans. It feels like we’re being put in a cage and prodded with electric wiring to see how far they can go. Transacting without a number has the same penalty, as does failure to register a birth. Then there’s a general penalty – which I suppose is for anything a policeman catches you with – put at six months in jail or a Sh5 million fine.
The jail cells are going to be quite full, if the Huduma Namba fiasco is anything to go by. Huduma Namba has been rife with miscommunication, threats, legalese and rampant confusion, topped with an insistence that despite all these things, Huduma Namba and Huduma Master Card must go on. Not only that, the issuing of the basic number has been fraught with appeals for return registration, extended deadlines (because obviously 35 million people did not register for this thing, as earlier lied) and incomplete information. How are they going to manage a countrywide card distribution when they can’t even issue IDs to Nubians in Nairobi?

I guess at some point they’ll get to me too and force me to register for something I care nothing for but will end up paying for regardless, browbeaten into submission by leaders I didn’t vote for, intent on selling my data for the next election and colonisation. It’s a bad idea, and I’m just adding my voice to the collective. Perhaps for once, the government will miraculously care for something other than its fat pockets and runaway borrowing."
Abigail Arunga,"In my opinion, there aren’t a lot of places to go in town that you can chill and hangout, have a drink, not have to watch your bag consistently, and get good service.

Then again, it’s been a bit of a while since the CBD has been a haunt of mine. That being said, when The Collective opened up in town, I couldn’t resist going to take a peek.

The Collective is a restaurant at View Park Towers, where Secrets used to be (look at me, showing my age). It’s now been made into a state of the art art gallery and eatery that delights all the senses, particularly your sight and your tongue.

It’s beautiful, and it’s clean. You walk in after the sign announcing its presence through the clear door, where a lovely security guard waits to welcome you, followed by the hostess.

You can either sit downstairs, in which case you will walk straight into the place, or go upstairs, up the stairs directly after the hostess station, and onwards.


There is a second set of stairs as well that lead to the same area, from the middle of the downstairs seating area, a bit like CJ’s in town but better planned and not as intrusive on someone wearing a skirt.

I generally sit upstairs, for varied reasons – I like the vibe of the upstairs area; I am usually there for their weekday performances, when there’s a songstress singing or DJ Frankie is playing.


 
I like the privacy it intimates when you’re far from the eyes of a crowd outside (which is anywhere in the restaurant, really, I am just being dramatic); and I like the private dining section that is upstairs as well. I enjoy The Collective generally, because it is a beautiful eating location, but I also love that the food matches the décor.

The day I was in town at this particular restaurant, I was distracted and hampered by the fact that I was hungry, and so I made the mistake of ordering far too much food.

Our waiter was kind with us and waited on our deliberations for almost 20 minutes as we decided on what to have. I wanted the spicy butternut soup and a medium done burger; my companion had the Norwegian salmon (which weighed in at a whopping 1950 a pop, probably one of the more expensive things on the menu).



The thing with The Collective is that you think the food is going to come in small baby fine dining portions. It doesn’t. Don’t make the same mistake I did. The food comes in hearty sizes, unapologetically so.

The spicy butternut soup was not even that spicy, but it was so good I wanted to lick my bowl – you know, the way we used to lick yoghurt cups when we were younger, including the cover? That is what I wanted to do with that soup.


By the time the burger and fries came, I only had space for half of that burger, and a few fries.

I don’t know why I thought I was so hungry – I was, but the soup was a lot. I had the rest packed for a later date.


 
Did I like how the burger tasted, though? Yes, I did – I just had no space for it. The salmon was pricy, but, it was very good salmon at the same time.

We were both very happy with our meal choices and decisions, as well as cocktails and such like, and excellent service.

If you haven’t been to The Collective, go soon. It’s in a convenient location, and it’s a perfect demonstration of what happens when two kinds of art – food, and canvas – merge together into perfection.
"
Abigail Arunga,"I was reading the Nation the other day and was quite shocked to discover that once again, the tax man is coming for someone else.

‘The Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) has set its sights on developers of income-generating digital applications (apps) as part of wider plans to rope online businesses into the tax net.

The app developers are staring at tax demands on downloads on their platforms and resultant revenue, the taxman announced Wednesday.


 
KRA says it will work with the Communications Authority of Kenya (CA) to obtain transactions data by resident and foreign-based app developers doing business in Kenya.’ (the East African)

This, apparently, will lead to platforms like YouTube and Netflix being taxed in Kenya.

On the one hand, I see the sense in taxing multimillion dollar global corporations for the money that they are making in Kenya, tax-free. Of course if Kenyans are using the product, and they are making money from Kenyans, then it makes sense to give the money to the Kenyan government, no?

The same has been done in several countries all over the world, such as France, who recently put a three percent tax levy on something similar. Uganda just did it as well, in a misguided manner that taxed the citizens for using digital platforms like Facebook, and that led to a third or so of internet users in Uganda falling off Facebook and the internet completely – because surely, the approximately Sh200 tax being levied is about how much a typical Kenyan user would use in four days, assuming one is buying bundles – even less if one is not a heavy user, or watching too many videos.

That, in my opinion, was going about it the wrong way.

My question, though, is, this is the next move in a series of strange moves that the government insists on in the name of generating more money to support Kenya’s ever-ballooning budget.

In the last few years, our budget has gone up astronomically, just in the space of our current president’s term. And yet, instead of understanding the basic precept that you cannot tax a country into prosperity, the government and its ministries insist on taxing something – anything – more. Instead of reducing our debt, we take on more.

Instead of sluicing off a few hundred members of the executive who do nothing, we increase allowances. Surely, in terms of basic financial management, the answer would be to stop spending so much money? Much like in high school, where if you needed more money after pocket money had run out, you would either reduce your buying of crisps at the tucky, as opposed to stealing money from your fellow cube mate.

And honestly, I’m just worried about what the tax man is going to try and take from me next. There’s no way they will stop at YouTube and Netflix, simply because there is no way that money will be enough, and the money will never be enough – not for prosperity, and not for the greed of those currently in power.

Inevitably, the taxation may become too much to maintain a market in a country these American companies don’t even care about.

Then what? More, and higher, fuel levies? A newly created pet tax, sounds familiar…how about tax for more garbage disposal that doesn’t even exist as we speak? What next, will we pay a tax for breathing also?
"
Abigail Arunga,"In a bid to remain relevant to his conservative pseudo-Christian superiors and fans, the Kenya Film Classification Board Chief Executive Ezekiel Mutua has once again stuck his nose where it does not need to be.

It is interesting that Mr Mutua is constantly coming out to protect the children, when in reality, it is not his role to protect them. In fact, he seems to be intent on protecting his own sensibilities first.

What is he doing this time? Insisting that certain songs in the public sphere be banned from being played outside nightclubs.

As the KFCB boss, Mr Mutua’s role is to watch and classify films as suitable or unsuitable for Kenyan audiences, and then rate tem in terms of age and appropriateness accordingly – among other functions that include licensing, etc.

IMAGINATION

It takes a great stretch of the imagination to think that this must also include music, that is not in a film, or needing to be classified. It is, once again, directly out of his mandate.

I am not here to argue about the appropriateness of the songs he is banning.

Certainly, the lyrics are not the most educative for supposed young minds.

But again – this is not his role. Ask those in charge of what airs when on television.

Ask those in charge of answering the questions from these children. Focus on actual proper civic and sexual health education in schools, so that these kids are not learning all they know about sex – yes, I said it – from lyrics of a hype song, yes?

INTERNET

And protecting children is a bit of a fallacy at this point in the age of the internet, unless parents will now ban television, school, music, and all human interactions and even then, children will find what they want to see.

Historically, banning something is the quickest way to get everyone to see it (but don’t tell Ezekiel that, please).

Indeed, the use of the ‘think of the children’ line has been historically used as a logical fallacy argument, in terms of invoking emotion such that logical thought goes out of the window, particularly in terms of encouraging censorship in the past.

This is not and cannot be the focus of the original argument – just because in the first place, how many things are you protecting the children from?

How can this really be implemented?

PROBLEM

And what is the real problem at hand, outside of Mutua’s, and Kenya’s, obsession with non-existent purity?

I can’t pretend to understand where Ezekiel Mutua’s saviour complex stems from, but I think what he is trying to do in a misguided way is call for more protocols in terms of what children are exposed to –and I use this term very loosely.

If that is the case, can whoever is supposed to do that take charge before Ezekiel creates a docket for himself with a pay that he can steal?

"
Abigail Arunga,"#FormNiGani is a campaign that’s been running for the past two weeks on social media, trying to get Kenyans to think about their futures and what steps they need to take now to get to the futures they want.

They staged an entire production on the day the campaign started, with a ‘visit’ from the president of Kenya’s future - a pregnant woman, who did not speak much, so as to not alter the course of time. They even had a newspaper of the future, talking about how Kenya’s curriculum was being studied by American specialists so they can duplicate it; there was a Kenyan musician performing at Coachella, and voting, from the future, in Kenya, is done via smartphone.

WE RISE

The thing is, to me, these things seem so very attainable. In spite of how Kenya’s leaders seem incredibly intent on running this country to the ground, still, we rise. Kenyans are by far some of the most innovative, inventive, adaptive – and funny – people on the planet. For some reason we thrive in spite of corruption. We beat through bureaucracy. We work, even when hampered by inefficient systems. If we wanted this to be our future, it could be – simply because what we’ve done so far seems almost impossible as is. Think of M-Pesa – our repeatedly touted success story, students from Strathmore Law School beating students from Harvard and a functional free healthcare system in Machakos.

It is our lack of planning that’s stopping us, and ourselves; how we think about the future, what we think, and how we don’t plan for it. It’s the systems, and the thought that needs to go into what we’re doing next. I wonder, 50 years from now, if newspapers will still be talking about scandals. I wonder if I’ll be alive to see it, or whether the potentially toxic chemicals that people keep putting into food will finally do us all in. I wonder if people would ever be willing to vote in a female president, considering how Kenyan men think about leadership and gender. I wonder if Central Bank will be able to put out new money, and actually have the stock to support it; I wonder if we’ll finally be able to ban plastic bags and give solidly environmentally feasible alternatives that don’t just transfer money from one person’s pocket to another.

CANNOT WAIT

I have a dream for Kenya, too – that one day, the systems will actually work for the people, not against them. I can’t wait to see laws that favour all Kenyans of all types of all ages, across the many definitions of what a Kenyan is. I can’t wait for thought and planning to be part and parcel of being an active citizen in this country – whether for voting, or reproductive choices, or just within our own homes, our own ethics, our own circles. I want Kenyans to have the choice to choose what is better for them, not having to be alchemists to create gold from whatever rubbish we are handed. We can have that in this lifetime, because the resources are available. What we have to work with is more than enough – if we start thinking about how we can create that gold, starting now.
"
Abigail Arunga,"Yesterday, when I was walking through town, around Integrity Centre, I caught a whiff of teargas that proceeded to grip and choke me while I was minding my business. Unfortunately, Jaguar and his people didn’t want me to enjoy the afternoon. Apparently, teargas canisters were unleashed as soon as Jaguar and his supporters showed up, because they were heckling, because Jaguar is being seen at Integrity centre for charges questioning his – well, integrity.

First of all, as someone who has innocently inhaled copious amounts of teargas for things that are not my fault, I wonder at the person who decides that these volleys should be let loose in the first place. I mean, more often than not, they are shot at people defending their own rights – as has been my experience every time I’m marching for Kenya, with other Kenyans, as other Kenyans with Kenyans threaten us with water cannons.

That being said, if his hecklers were actually just being unruly because he was arrested, it really makes me question how, in 2019, the Kenyan mind is still functioning on voting for and supporting the guy who has the hit songs that all sound the same (like his campaign promises) and the other guy with the shiniest Range Rover.

I vote in Starehe. I was really hoping that Boniface Mwangi would take this seat. I know that is wishful thinking, somewhat, considering everything Boniface is and what he is generally associated with – but I was hoping that the people of Starehe would at least give him a chance. I didn’t think he would be in fourth place. Fourth! After we have been crying for leadership and assistance and begging for our rights to be fought for. Fourth! It’s enough to shake even the most patriotic of souls.

Instead, Jaguar was the choice. Jaguar who, to my knowledge, above and beyond crying on television, hasn’t done much more for Starehe. Jaguar who, in spite of his associations, as well, was voted in and now riles up his people to rile up others when he’s facing the possibility of accountability for what he is suspected to have done. And who is running with him, causing chaos? The people he has done nothing for.

It has always been my deepest hope that Kenyans rise from the slumber that they’re so comfortable with. But today, after I choked on the air, I realised that it is not yet Uhuru, even with Uhuru at the supposed helm. The revolutionaries are treated so badly, no one even wants to be revolutionary now. So what happens to a dying country? Who saves it, since it apparently won’t be ourselves?

Abigail Arunga,"Now, every movie I watch with an Asian-oriented cast is always going to be compared with blockbuster hit Crazy Rich Asians, and with good reason — CRA broke the box office boundaries of what could be seen as a successful film, and took no prisoners.

Always Be My Maybe was released on a smaller screen — Netflix — but it has actors and a storyline just as worthy, with the same romcom flair.

FIXES PLUMBING IN HER HEART

Wong plays an incredibly successful chef about to open up a new restaurant in her hometown, with a fiancé who doesn't really seem to want to get married and a personal assistant with almost no filter.

Her hometown also means her old hometown flings — namely, Park, who is dating a hippie and still playing for the band he played for in high school.

He hasn't moved on from what he was, but she may or may not have moved from her feelings for him — but they'll discover whether this is for sure after he fixes the plumbing in her heart — err, I mean, house.
"
Abigail Arunga,"I'm always looking for tacos that can beat out my steady favourite, Fonda.

Fonda has the best tacos (kwanza the fish ones, the pescado ones. I know you wouldn't expect fish tacos to be great, but when you taste them, you'll wonder how you ever had anything else, and how you ever thought fish tacos were a bad thing).

That being said, because their tacos are so good, everyone else just pales in comparison.


This was definitely true for the taco place at Village Market. You know how Village Market has like 42 different restaurants all of a sudden, and so you're literally and figuratively spoiled for choice when you get there?

Sometimes, choice isn't a good thing. Needless to say, Fonda is still winning the tough taco competition taking place in my heart.


The taco joint at Vima is called Taco Bar. While I'm a big fan of the Mexican Fiesta type décor, I don't think I would necessarily want to go back again. The drinks are fairly priced – I had a strawberry margarita (mistake number two, after walking into the place) – which I didn't think was worth the 650 I paid for it.

But this is the thing – they're trying to offer a skimped Mexican experience, and it just isn't cutting it.


 
They have various taco options – Baja Style Fish, Chivo Guistado (goat), Frijoles Negros (black beans), Carnitas (pulled pork), and a Butternut and Kale option that brings the vegetarian possibilities to two, unless you're vegan, in which case, that's one choice.


You get three for 900, or one for 350. You can add extras, like guacamole (which they serve in nice big quantities) or chip (which are just Ola chips that it doesn't make the most sense to pay 90 bob for).

Everything was just ok. The tacos didn't blow my mind. The avocado did, but then again, it's avocado. Of course it is going to blow my mind. That's a given. The margarita was meh.


The seating and the décor was cool, but I don't go to a place solely for seating and décor. I need to check out the other restaurants that the Village Market complex has to offer, because I definitely won't be coming back to this one.
"
Abigail Arunga,"For those of you who are new here, I love brunch.

I love everything to do with breakfast, and when you add non-traditional breakfast foods to it, plus alcohol if that's your flavour, I love it even more (ironically, I rarely have mimosas outside of brunch, and rarely do alcohol where brunch is involved in the first place). For those of you who are not new here – I went to another brunch!


Initially my brunching friends and I were supposed to check out the Shamba Cafe, which is located, as I understand, somewhere in the middle of Loresho. But fate turned our hand – we made a reservation, for sitting outside, but then it started to rain.

And so the cafe closed down the outside seating area, which meant the inside area was doubly full – which meant, according to the person answering the phone, that there was going to be no space for us to sit, reservation or no, until 2pm.


We were not at all willing to wait that long, and so we decided to go to the secondary option that was decided during our monthly brunch planning meeting. That sounds a lot fancier than it actually is – it's usually decided upon during a loose happy hour, and it sticks.

The second joint was a spot off Kiambu Road called The Goat Cafe – alternately known, on social media, as The Goat Social Club. Which I decided was a bit of an exaggeration when we got there, but we went nonetheless.


The Google Maps pin will take you a little past the actual joint, so you should just stop on Mushroom Road when you see the sign and turn in as opposed to following the location. It's right next to Adele Dejak's place, so look out for either of those.


The word I would use to describe the décor would be a combination of three: rustic shabby chic. Think the Alchemist but smaller and with more kitschy things.

They're not too focused on whether or not the fixtures are modern or the seats are brand new – a contrast to most Nairobian restaurants, which I suppose is what they were going for. They're into the unfinished walls and stuffing puffing out seats type of layout, which I was not crazy about, but I really wanted to try the food, so in we went.


They have a widely varied assortment of wall hangings, from classic paintings to the rudimentary, to random eccentric chandeliers hanging above the main service counter. The area extends into an outside seating area, but I was far too cold to give this any attention.

We sat down and were brought the menu. The menu is small, and additions or sides are not necessarily an option, so don't go expecting to be able to add bacon to anything, really.


The brunch menu consisted of one choice of (goat, seafood or veg) taco, a crepe, and a hot drink, for Sh1,850. Though the taco was sizeable, and tasty, to me, it didn't feel very much like a brunch meal that was particularly special.

I had the burger, done medium rare, from the original menu, which was very tasty and took me all of seven minutes to finish. I also added a salad, because I thought the burger would be too small, but my eyes were much bigger than my stomach, and I ended up taking it away.


But also, I wasn't extra motivated about the salad for some reason – it was a spicy chicken salad with sweet potatoes in it as well, but I think it was the beets addition that turned me off. I'm not a big fan of beets.


Would I go back to the Goat Cafe? Probably not, but I understand it's appeal in a back-of-the-woods hidden spot kind of way. The food was good, which is what this column is about, isn't it?
"
Bitange Ndemo,"After the xenophobic attacks in South Africa (SA) last week, several questions popped up in my mind.

When does the struggle for freedom end? Did Africa fail to educate citizens about the responsibilities that come with self-rule?


 
Aluta continua (Portuguese for “the struggle continues”) was the rallying cry of the Mozambique Liberation Front (Frelimo).

Samora Moisés Machel, the leader of the movement and later the first President of an independent Mozambique, liked the phraseology so much that he made it an unofficial national motto. So entrenched was this saying that even today, there are posters with the slogan in Maputo.

In SA, the phrase Amandla! (Nguni language for ""power"") was a common phrase during anti-apartheid struggle. The leaders would call “Amandla” and the audiences would respond, ""AwethuI"" or ""Ngawethu!” (meaning, “to us”).
 
In effect, and in hindsight, the leaders were promising “power to the people” without explaining the meaning.

Since the mid-1800, America described itself as a melting pot (a fusion of many nationalities) coming together to exploit opportunities through the clarion call to immigrants to come to “the Land of Opportunity.”

The phrase has served the Americans for centuries, attracting many to a place where they could achieve whatever they wanted to do no matter their background. Studies have shown that America’s greatness is partly a consequence of its diversity.

Rallying cries or clarion calls are powerful emotional tools and are often as good as a strong brand whose sole purpose is to ingrain the product or idea in people’s minds to create a positive association.

In theory, and in practice, the phrases are short and memorable. However, in virtually all cases, the operational definition of such terminologies is never given. A single phrase could have different interpretations by different people.

If a phrase was meant to achieve short-term objectives, then as they say ‘Dawa ya moto ni moto’ (Kiswahili for medicine for fire is fire), you will need another equally powerful phrase to erase the one that needs to be erased.

Mozambique should have devised another phrase to erase aluta continua, which indeed has no place since the country had attained self-rule to reverse most of the injustices the colonists had imposed on the people.

Instead some of the people went back into the forest to continue with the war that cost the country many lives.

In recent times, Americans seem to be replacing the phrase ‘Land of Opportunity’ with that of ‘America First,’ a foreign policy orientation that focuses on United States of America’s unilateralism.

According to Ruth Sarles, in her book, A Story of America First: The Men and Women who Opposed US Intervention in World War II, the idea dates back to second world war. The policy has, however, been revived by President Donald Trump and seems to resonate with a huge population so much that he could be re-elected in 2020.

The pre-Independence crying calls need to be erased from the people’s memories by creating new sustainable ones. The clarion call that is imperative is the one calling on the people to unite as a continent for prosperity or seek skills and work hard to better our lives.

Prior to the White man coming to Africa, there were no distinctive boundaries to distinguish Azania from Zimbabwe. It makes sense therefore developing a One Africa phraseology.

There must be an end date for promises independence leaders made. In Kenya, for example, the promise of “Matunda ya Uhuru” (the fruits of independence) sometimes take the connotation of free fruits of independence

The phrase has in some cases created conflict. The phrase is sometimes the basis for asking the government to provide everything, causing woes instead.

Bitange Ndemo,"All I knew about Hon. Okoth was that he was a gentleman.

I first met him in 2013 at the launch of MAP Kibra event in his constituency. His infectious smile said more about him than his words. He later tweeted to thank me for gracing the occasion, thus demonstrating his humility.

I have had many interactions with members of Parliament but none has ever remembered to do what Ken did.  He was in his own league. 

His demeanour then was that of a great leader who was genuinely cared about the people he represented and had great interested in what the youths from his constituency were doing. 

Like all of us, he may have “fallen short of glory” but the way we have laid bare his frailties raises the question of how much speakers at the funeral should reveal when the loved ones of the diseased are still grieving. 

Eulogies, even those of criminals, have never exposed the departed in the negative light. It was painful to watch some leaders discuss data relating to Hon. Okoth on TV without his consent, or that of his family.  In my view, need data protection laws now than ever before.

SHENANIGANS

His death has been subject of discussion in several fora. From would be friends who controversially eulogised him, to his own wishes to be cremated, to polemical community reactions from Kabondo. 

Ken did not deserve any of these shenanigans especially after he boldly announced that he had cancer.  Interestingly, only a few of the mourning loudmouths sought to see him in the hour he needed love.

Although different cultures have different ways of celebrating the dead, virtually all of these cultures respect the departed.  If anybody had any advice to the departed, they had time to do so when he revealed that he had a terminal disease.


 
In my view, we have never had any discussion on what should or shouldn’t be said at a funeral.  There are indeed many questions that should be guiding us when eulogizing someone. 

Does the maxim 'don't speak ill of the dead' still hold in this day and age?  Is it fair to the departed to present a truthful account of his/her life when he is no longer around to provide a counter narrative?  

Does anyone have a right, constitutional or otherwise, to discuss the affairs of the dead openly? What constitutes a great eulogy?

Funerals are supposed to be great occasions for family, friends and relatives to celebrate the diseased. That is why we often say that we give the dead the funeral befitting their stature. 

There are basically two to three common techniques of eulogising someone.  The first, mostly from close family members, are lengthy teary tributes focusing on the life history. The other, mostly by friends, and tends to inject humour mostly around shared memories.  Relatives often give a combination of life history and shared memories.

It must be acknowledged that in much of the 21st century, funerals have changed owing to the fact that the conception of death and life has been altered by the advent of Christianity and Islam in the continent. 

Nevertheless, the practice of religion in Africa is complex. Whilst some communities have abandoned old African religions in favour of “modernity,” others have a dualistic religious practice of the past and present.  The Encyclopedia of Death and Dying on African religions says:

“In the religions of Africa, life does not end with death, but continues in another realm. The concepts of ""life"" and ""death"" are not mutually exclusive concepts, and there are no clear dividing lines between them…… Death does not alter or end the life or the personality of an individual, but only causes a change in its conditions. This is expressed in the concept of ""ancestors,"" people who have died but who continue to ""live"" in the community and communicate with their families.”

CREMATION

Indeed, when even the most educated men go out to drink liquor, they first feed the ancestors before they partake any of the drink. 

Some of the controversies around Hon. Okoth can be seen in light of the conflict between the past and present. 


 
The concept of cremation comes with a sense of finality that leaves no hope that he will be among the ancestors.

In a confused state of affairs and a broader audience beyond family, friends and relatives, the dynamics of delivering a good eulogy within acceptable confines, becomes difficult or is driven by outside circumstances. In such cases the family suffers double jeopardy – the loss of a loved one, compounded by offensive tributes or irrelevant political harangues.

Consider for example, the controversial funeral of musician Aretha Franklin‘s 9-hour “Celebration of Life” where Atlanta pastor Reverend Jasper Williams Jr., was accused of delivering an “offensive and distasteful” eulogy. 

Williams, knowing that Ms. Franklin was a single mother, had claimed that single mothers cannot “raise a black boy to become a man.” He further asserted that a household without a father is an “abortion after birth.” Clearly the Reverend was out of order.

The Reverend could have said the same thing in a positive way. Note how Ossie Davis eulogized Malcolm X by raising all the negatives a racist would say but in a positive manner.

Many will ask what Harlem finds to honor in this stormy, controversial and bold young captain – and we will smile. Many will say turn away – away from this man, for he is not a man but a demon, a monster, a subverter and an enemy of the black man – and we will smile. They will say that he is of hate – a fanatic, a racist – who can only bring evil to the cause for which you struggle!

Political speeches in funerals are increasingly becoming offensive. They rarely address the bereaved families as they are supposed to.  Instead, they focus on audiences that seldom represent the family.  It is time to learn what should or should not be said in a funeral.

“Since, therefore, no man is born without faults, and he is esteemed the best whose errors are the least, let the wise man consider everything human as connected with himself for in worldly affairs there is no perfect happiness under heaven.”


 
Although Welshman Giraldus Cambrensis said these words in the 13th century, they remain true to date.

Those stocking controversy around Ken Okoth’s departure should put the matter to rest.

"
Bitange Ndemo,"Peter Kuguru, founder of Kuguru Foods, is a maverick. He ventured into soda manufacturing without muscle to fight established global brands with deep pockets.

He has nevertheless made a mark and walked away with priceless knowledge in failure. He is a wise man. He knew when to walk away. In his famous song ‘‘The Gambler’’ Kenny Rogers advises: “You've got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em, know when to walk away, And know when to run.”


 
This portion of the song reveals that entrepreneurship is a gamble whose success depends on how much risk one takes. Sometimes you lose. What matters most, however, is the courage to start all over again.

Softa’s exit was forced by monopolies in the sector. Consumers will have less choice and this is how monopolies like to play.

Dominant players use a strategy known as “category captain system” whereby retailers favour bigger suppliers in product category and give them the responsibility to determine where their competitor products will be placed. In return, the retailer gets concession from monopolies to smother competitors. In this case startups like Softa have no chance of scaling up when the customer has no visibility of the product.

In the isles of soft drinks, several brands that are seemingly independent and supposedly competing with each other are actually products of the same company.

For example, if you had a problem with Brookside milk and instead you purchase the next brand like Tuzo, Fresha, Dairy Fresh milk, Brookside still wins. Same when you buy Sprite, Coke, 7Up, Krest, Minute Maid, or Fanta: Coca Cola wins.

Two global monopolies will literary take up all shelf space so that a brand like Softa becomes virtually invisible. This strategy is used by many food industry manufacturers to dominate the shelves and deny competitors any chance of visibility.

Another strategy to eliminate small players is called “monopsony power” where giant retailers use their monopoly power to force suppliers cut prices to the extent that some suppliers compromise on product quality to meet the objectives of the retailer.

In the recent past several small manufacturers have collapsed in the hands of giant retailers simply because these retailers fail to pay for supplies. Carrefour for example, demanded that suppliers pay a non-refundable fee of Sh1.4 million to do business with it. A demand that effectively discriminates small manufacturers in their own country.

Some large manufacturers, particularly in the alcohol industry, have been accused of buying competitor products and destroying them as a strategy to ensure that no one consumes a new brand.

In a free market economy like Kenya, it is only through regulation that these unethical practices can be eliminated to give consumers a wider range of choice and encourage innovation to get the best products locally. If such practices were to show up in banking sector, the regulator would immediately deal with that. Kuguru is therefore right in faulting the government for failure to protect not only small manufacturers but consumers too.

The government must step up surveillance to protect local manufacturers and help them succeed.

This is important because some foreign “investors” sometimes advance the narrative that Africans will never be good in manufacturing.

Unfortunately, there are many who have bought this narrative to the extent that locally produced goods are shunned in favour of foreign goods.

This perhaps explains why manufacturing contribution to GDP declined from a high of 12.7 percent in 2007 to a low of 8.4 percent in 2017.

From Vision 2030 to Big 4 Agenda, Kenya has always prioritised value addition and manufacturing as a strategy for employment and wealth creation but we have never delved into the dynamics of growing local Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises.

In most cases, foreign investors have had more concessions than local entrepreneurs. A deliberate policy could push medium enterprises into large manufacturing entities and likewise Micro to Small and Small to Medium.

We must learn from the failures of Kuguru and how Asian Tigers succeeded in building local manufacturing industry.

For a start, we need to provide local entrepreneurs with Business Development Services to help build capacity, especially in overcoming such barriers as highlighted in this article, build markets as well as boosting operational and strategic issues of local enterprises."
Bitange Ndemo,"Last week I was speaking to someone who works for an international organisation with headquarters in the United States. She recalled how her colleagues at HQ were oscillating between various stages of fear, angst and utter despondency at the ongoing George Floyd anti-racism protests that had resulted in looting and curfews in multiple American cities. Her American colleagues were shaken to the core and struggling to find answers to how the country’s society was seemingly unravelling fast.

The lady chuckled, recalling how during the Kenyan post-election tensions in 2017, her American colleagues were fairly reticent in their direction, guiding the Kenyan office to just work from home, but continue working. The social tensions in a far off remote corner of the globe were distant and incomprehensible. But now the same kind of tensions, laying to bare existential questions on the equality of citizenry and police brutality, pulled at the tenuous strings of the peaceful American societal fabric.


 
As a large consumer of American literature, movies and academic case studies, last week’s protests coupled with the never ending squabbles between the federal government and state governors on the appropriate response to the Covid-19 pandemic threw me for a loop.

How could a country that has for decades lectured the rest of the world on human rights and democracy and upended various regimes in the Middle East fail to provide basic personal protective equipment to frontline health workers? How could a country, whose movies the whole world has consumed, including those that fictionally promised they would save the world in the event of an alien invasion or hurtling asteroid – cue Independence Day and Armageddon – be reduced to political grandstanding in the distribution of life saving ventilators to states that were led by Republic governors? I have so many questions.

In the academic space locally, we have for years drawn on many case studies of American companies that have brilliantly succeeded or spectacularly failed in business. The reason local academia has relied heavily on these American case studies, in my limited experience, is because there exists in America an abundance of academic writing skills as well as troves of published financial data, analyst reports produced after numerous detailed investor briefings and, most importantly, unbridled willingness on the part of current and former management to tell their side of the story. But for many of my East African corporate governance students consisting of directors in both the public and private sectors, the stories ring hollow to their seasoned ears. For years, consistent feedback has been that they want more local stories based on local circumstances as the directors are well aware that what happens in Western climes is based on an extremely different socio-economic and political context.

Very few academic case studies exist for local companies and a handful have been written by American universities who’ve managed to crack open tightly sealed corporate lips. The challenge has largely been around the fact that our closely knit society whether in Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda or Rwanda ensures that it is difficult to get data from existing management that may indict former management or vice versa.

Further, there isn’t the same amount of corporate information symmetry as exists in developed markets for unlisted companies. I once used a local case study in class, based on data collected anecdotally and from the media and was embarrassed to find one participant avoid the class altogether as he was related to the shareholders and couldn’t bear to listen to the class dissect the decisions and internal politics that were causing the company to decline.

The upshot of this is that recent events in the American socio-political milieu, as well as the global disruption of supply chains will lead local consumers to become more discerning of, and demanding for local content and products.

The benefits of this era will definitely be a deeper sense of Afrocentricity and looking for local solutions to local problems and needs.

Watching developed nations struggle with managing this public health crisis and the resultant recessive economic impact is a stark wake up call for Africans to realise that not all answers come from the West. And for those of us in local academia, now more than ever is the time to establish a body of local case studies particularly of companies that will have successfully or unsuccessfully navigated this period. Our problems are our own to solve."
Bitange Ndemo,"On July 25, 2019, the Cabinet Secretary in the Ministry of Information and Communications, Joseph Mucheru, launched the Distributed Ledgers and Artificial Intelligence report.

The report details how the country can leverage emerging exponential technologies to solve some of the major problems the country is facing.


 
These include: endemic corruption, weak democratic and electoral process, ballooning national debt, exclusive financial systems, expensive transaction cost and poor public service delivery.

The fight against corruption can be minimised through use of blockchain and Artificial Intelligence (AI). These technologies are already being used by several governments to improve governance.

For example, after Spain slid eight points to become one of the most corrupt countries in the European Union, it started to leverage blockchain and AI after changing their anti-corruption laws. The change has started to pay off. The Scandinavian countries for example, have built blockchain-powered land registries to make the details of real estate transactions visible to all interested parties including the tax agencies to eliminate tax evasion.

Other governments using these emerging technologies to improve on transparency in their land registries include: Ghana, Georgia and Ukraine. We can therefore eliminate persistent racketeering in land registries by deploying Blockchain technology.

The new technologies could also be used to minimise controversies in our elections. We are optimistic that by 2022, we should at least use blockchain to manage the elections of Members of County Assemblies (MCAs).

The process will create ledgers for all political parties, observers and the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission such that each interested party will have visibility on how the votes are trickling in and can be validated at the same time.

With a digital asset framework, the country can mobilize local resources and avoid borrowing expensive loans. For example, the construction of the Mombasa- Nairobi expressway could be an investment that Kenyans can crowdsource from contributing as low as Sh100 to as much as one can afford.

As it is at the moment, Kenyans have put billions of dollars in foreign cryptocurrencies whose utilities are unknown. These resources estimated to be at least 1.6 percent of the GDP are enough to help government reduce its foreign borrowings that largely consist of excess capital that is used to enslave us when we have the capability to support our development.

There is no doubt that digital money has caused a financial revolution in Kenya. Several studies confirm that digital currency has created unprecedented financial inclusion. Just a few years ago, only five percent of Kenyans had bank accounts compared to more than 90 percent who have had to open bank accounts through mobile phones.

Soon, the emerging technologies will make it possible to lower the exorbitant interest rates on mobile borrowing.

The fight to lower the cost of transactions has started in earnest. Facebook’s Libra is promising free transaction cost and targeting the bottom of the pyramid.

It is expected that other mobile money providers will lower their cost or build new business models that will eliminate transaction charges altogether.

These changes will continue to bring efficiency to the people. To take full advantage of these technologies, however, the government must embark on digitisation of records, develop data analytics capability, build a robust biometric identity system that is key to the success of a digital economy and ensure affordable broadband throughout the country.

Already much has been done through the Huduma Centers but more services could be added and greatly improve public service delivery.

The launch of the Distributed Ledgers and Artificial Intelligence Report will bring us closer to building a robust digital economy.

With it, Kenya will leapfrog several stages of development, solve many endemic problems and help Kenyans create new jobs and wealth.

"
Bitange Ndemo,"Last week on the NTV’s Sidebar program, I participated in a panel discussion about the ongoing debate on the state of Universities in Kenya.

With me were Prof Karuti Kanyinga of the University of Nairobi and David Aduda, Nation Media Group's head of business development. The program was anchored by Debarl Inea.

Long after the debate, my mind was still searching for solutions to the problem. It was becoming clear that these reforms are wider than what the policy makers are attempting to do.

As they say, where there's smoke, there's fire. This metaphor implies that rumours or things that we say without sufficient evidence have some foundation that they could be true. This is precisely what we are going through with respect to education reforms and we are not alone.

The narrative on higher education in Kenya is that our universities are: not producing employable graduates; issuing questionable degrees; using outdated teaching methodologies; not doing research and teaching wrong courses.

All these are being said without scientific evidence that these problems are systemic in all institutions of higher learning.

This narrative grows stronger by the day to the extent that, it is possible that some universities have flouted regulations and compromised their standards. In which case we need to strengthen regulations in order to protect consumers.

But regulation alone may not be sufficient to rectify the mess in our higher education, because education of the future is going to be radically different from what we know of it today.
The problem is that no one really understands exactly what we need to meet the future demands of education. Instead, we simply say we need to reform our education. Like my friend Prof Kanyinga says, we need to define our problem clearly before we embark on any form of reforms in educations.

I agree with him. Although there is clearly a need for reforms, virtually everyone has some hidden agenda that may not be acceptable to everybody else.


 
In recent times we have started to vilify arts education in favour of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). Yet there are thousands of young people with STEM-based college education that are still unemployed.

CHANGE TACT

Others are advocating for STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics) but despite the push for STEAM, there are suspicion that the curriculum is wanting and that we need to change tact.

Even if we were to agree on curriculum, and aside from the internal management issues in universities, differences of opinion exist along approach, structure, people’s aspirations and financing.

It is argued that current teaching approaches are more geared towards academics instead of focusing on creative thinking, problem-based learning, design thinking, expanded problem solving capabilities, and other innovative approaches.

These areas are supposed to enhance creativity, innovation and entrepreneurialism that will in turn create the much-needed jobs.

The priority in reforms should then focus on the ability to change teaching approaches and introduction of new curriculum in a similar manner as it is happening with the lower school where competence-based curriculum is underway.

On people’s aspirations, we must take into consideration promises of the past with respect to education. The mantra has been, get a good education if you want to succeed. Virtually every young citizen’s aspiration, and their parents’, is to get an education to change their livelihood.

The role of policy, then, is to continue to encourage people to work towards achieving their dreams and maximise their potential. And those of us in academia, we must work towards producing the best that can work anywhere in the world.


 
It is easy to craft solutions like limiting further expansion of universities but implementation will always be our Achilles heel. This is because we have always ignored our political, social and economic environment that impacts on our decisions.

One will always have to deal with these issues in addressing people’s aspirations if implementation is to succeed. Let people dream, succeed and, of course, fail. These are costs for building a stable and non-discriminatory society.

ONE EMPLOYER

On structure and financing, there is need to prescribe benchmarked standards. There is need to radically review the Universities Act by bringing all public universities under one employer and leverage that to deal with the problem of tribalism that is slowly tearing down universities.

Each university should have clear Key Performance Indicators with respect to research and development (generating new ideas and knowledge) leading to new innovations that are applicable to local problems, assist students to create start-ups and incubate them as a strategy to creating wealth for their respective institutions.

In seeking to create new ideas and knowledge, the universities will inevitably begin moving towards the future of education that will largely be driven by the emerging exponential technologies.

What we need at the moment is investments in research and development, less bureaucracy and good managers to help universities contribute to economic development.

It was envisaged that Kenya will invest at least one percentage of Gross Domestic Product in research and development but that have never been achieved.

The problems with public universities are many that we need to investigate properly and build the case for reforms. We also need an inclusive process that will lead to sustainable solutions.

It is, however, not the policy maker’s role to determine the optimal number of universities in the country. Let that be the role of market dynamics and an effective regulatory regime.
"
Bitange Ndemo,"It is a given that innovation will always precede regulation. The emerging Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) will give rise to many disruptive technologies that ought to be regulated.

Many of these technologies will change our lives for the better while others might have the opposite effect. No one disputes that regulation is necessary. However, knee-jerk regulation is not the answer. There was a good example of such unthinking reaction last week when the US Congress blocked Facebook’s Libra Cryptocurrency. Clearly, the US Congress erred. There are many different types of cryptocurrencies, but the ones that are of great concern are utility/security and general coins, sometimes referred to as tokens.

A utility token is a form of digital currency created for the purpose of raising capital for a venture. It means that the buyer of the utility token pays the issuer in exchange of a share of the investment that can be redeemed at a later date.

The process is called initial coin offers (ICO) like the initial purchase offer (IPO) in the stock exchange. The crypto coins function just like fiat currency (its value is backed by the issuing government) except that it is in digital format and can be used to buy goods and services.

In essence, crypto coins operate just like mobile money, a digital form of currency that is backed by the national currency that is not on blockchain.

Libra token, therefore, is M-Pesa. It is backed by financial assets and exchanges one on one to the dollar and by extension a basket of other currencies. One of its purposes is to serve the underserved (people without access to traditional banking) and enable consumers to purchase the currency and use it to pay for goods and services.

It is, however, on a permissioned blockchain, a platform with a security layer managing those who can have access to the network of individuals and enterprises. Such a layer minimizes platform vulnerabilities that can undermine its credibility if money launderers were to penetrate the system.

All the US Congress needed was to ask Facebook to permission the regulators into their blockchain and study their activities for some time to enable innovation and regulation.

Instead, they sought answers from what they knew without regard to a world that is constantly under disruption. They sought to know if Libra was money and whether Libra Association was a bank somewhere in Switzerland. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told the Senate that “there isn’t any one agency that can stand up and have oversight over this.”

Their fears centre on lack of intermediaries that they can hold accountable. Is Libra an investment currency with volatility such as the one witnessed? It isn’t. There wasn’t anyone seeking to understand the benefit these disruptive technologies will bring over and above the existing problems such as money laundering and other harmful transactions in the dark web. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime reported that the estimated amount of money laundered globally in 2018 is 2 – 5 percent of global GDP, or $800 billion - $2 trillion in current US dollars.

Other reports say illicit financial flows, that is, illegal movement of cash (like multinational corporations misreporting the value of their imports or exports to reduce tax) between countries, accounted for $68bn a year, three times as much as the $19bn Africa received in aid.

If the current problem of illicit financial flows is well acknowledged, the Congress should be asking if the new technologies will solve the problem.

Indeed, online magazine Fintech Futures of March 6, 2018, acknowledge the fact that 4IR technologies such as Artificial intelligence and machine learning are playing a significant role in the decline of fraud in the banking sector.

Several other studies show that blockchain's decentralized technology can enable banks and financial institutions to be more effective in prevention of fraud and money laundering.

The US Congress’ fears are misplaced. They need lessons from Kenya on how to regulate digital currency even when there is limited capacity as we did in 2007. What we had was abundant courage to allow Mobile money while learning how to regulate the emergent technology.

With Silicon Valley having pioneered many of the disruptive technologies that have become the envy of many countries, it will be an anti-climax for Congress to stand in their way. It will also send wrong signals to countries that are in the nascent stages of innovativeness.

"
Bitange Ndemo,"There is a popular idiom that says ‘'if it ain't broke, don't fix it.'’ This means that if something is working, leave it alone.

In May 1977, Thomas Bertram Lance, then the director of the Office of Management and Budget in President Jimmy Carter's administration was quoted by the newsletter of the US Chamber of Commerce, Nation's Business explaining that the trouble with government was “fixing things that aren't broken and not fixing things that are broken.""


 
In the recent past, President Donald Trump’s administration did exactly what Lance had stated. The US barred Chinese companies from accessing its technologies like Google’s Android operating system, microchips from Qualcomm and other hardware components.

Exports to China didn’t need fixing. The balance of trade favours China. The response from China has been swift. Huawei released Harmony, its own version of operating system. This is a journey they have travelled before.

When they suspended the Google search engine from China, they quickly built Baidu. In e-commerce, Alibaba soared. And in messaging, social media and mobile payment, they developed Tencent in 2011, which by 2018 became the world’s largest mobile app with more than one billion active users.

A new report, ‘‘Is China Catching Up to the United States in Innovation?’’, released in April 2019, Robert Atkinson and Caleb Foot writing for Information Technology & Innovation Foundation (ITIF) noted that China is closing the innovation gap.

The report, using 36 different metrics, showed that China has either caught up or leapfrogged the US in terms of innovation. It is not just a copier as policy makers want to believe, the report says.

These back and forth reactions have sparked of a new technology race. China’s advancement in semiconductor research is closely monitored by the US Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) as noted in their April 2019 report, ‘‘Winning the Future: A Blueprint for Sustained US Leadership in Semiconductor Technology’’, which calls for an increment in federal funding from $1.5 billion to $5 billion annually.

Reports show that the Chinese government is injecting more than $5 billion to support the country’s microchip industry research.

From a third-party view, it is an unnecessary race since the two countries very much depend on each other. In terms of market for example, China is the lifeblood of some US tech giants.

Qualcomm, one of the largest chip manufacturers in the world, had revenues of $22.7 billion in 2018 of which China and Hong Kong contributed $15,149 billion, South Korea ($3,175 billiion), US ($603 million), and the rest of the world ($3,805 billion). Disrupting such a huge market is akin to shooting yourself on the foot.

If the trade war continues, companies that are dependent on the Chinese market will suffer. Qualcomm’s revenues, for example, are projected to drop by 26 percent and could have a huge impact on its share price. Clearly, it is a mistake to rattle China with a trade war. On mobile phones, International Data Corporation (IDC) shows that Huawei sold 206 million smartphones in 2018, of which more than 51 percent were sold in china.

It is noteworthy to know that the trade war will not completely shut off Huawei from using the publicly available basic version of Android operating system. They will, however, not be able to use some of Google services some of which the Chinese government had blocked.

China, therefore, will have time to perfect Harmony. Having leapfrogged several other ICT services like search engines, e-commerce and social media platforms, it won’t be surprising to see Harmony vaulting ahead of Android and iOS in record time.

There is no doubt that by the time the dust settles, China will have greatly benefited from the disruption. They will intensify their research capability and begin to leapfrog some of the technologies that have taken years to perfect.

They have shown ability to astonishingly shorten their technology learning curve. Having come from behind, they have a point to prove. Besides, several countries, including some European ones, may be sympathetic to their predicament with Trump.

In my view, the US-China trade war may be a blessing in disguise for the Chinese. Economic analysts have always argued that no one really wins in a trade war.

"
Bitange Ndemo,"In the recent past, media has been asking many questions regarding the economy. 

These questions include: If the economy is growing as the Government says, why then are employers laying off staff in large numbers? Why are non-performing loans increasing? Why are people defaulting on their mortgages and losing their properties? How come that the country lost its competitiveness in 2018 and sunk into a deficit of Sh156 million in trade within African?

TOUGH QUESTIONS

As media fills its pages with tough questions, it doesn’t take a genius to know that consumer spending is up. The country is bourgeoning with global brands in new malls, making our neighbours happy with huge food imports in excess of $1 billion in the first six months as well as changing lifestyle with more people increasingly eating outside the home as new global restaurants scamper for space to whet our increasing appetites for foreign foods.

What is going on?  These contradictions make it harder for any economist to predict whether we are headed for a recession or economic boom. 

If the economy is doing great as reflected in the GDP growth and we are petulant, then we are missing the opportunities that foreigners are seeing. 

It is perhaps time that we ask ourselves very difficult questions as a basis of understanding that which is trending in our economic environment.

Two malls, Sarit and Village Market, have expanded their facilities and virtually all the spaces have been taken by global brands. At least four new malls have sprung up also housing several international brands, these brands don’t just randomly invest in emerging markets. 

They do a lot of research beyond economic indicators like GDP per capita.

While we grumble that the government has not made us to think, non-Kenyans are seeing opportunity and exploiting it sometimes using inputs from their own countries.


 
It defeats logic when a mall the size of the Hub thrives with foreign restaurants and not a single local eatery. Most of these brands do not even use local flour and no one has bothered to find out including our often-avaricious MPs.

We are simply importing resources that make money for foreign companies then they ship it out as profits without ever contributing to the local economy. In most countries, you cannot import potatoes if the same can be produced locally. The onus is placed on the investor to train locals to produce potatoes of their standard requirement. 

In my view, we are relying too much on government to guide us to navigate complex economic issues. 

We must be part of the solution to economic performance.  In essence, we should wake up and exploit emerging opportunities.

The government cannot direct private citizens to areas of opportunity. It is the private citizen who takes the risk and exploits the opportunity and only seeks government assistance if there are unfair practices in the markets. 

LOCAL INVESTORS

Some of the multinationals misbehave and, in the process, undermine local investors.

It is common knowledge for example that Multinationals elsewhere are helping farmers in emerging economies to exploit opportunity and succeed. American giant retailer, Walmart, has a program called Direct Farm programme where the retailer buys directly from the farmers through its own distributor and guarantee steady market and access to finance. 

Walmart provides the training and advisory services to the farmers ensuring that the farmers meet their standards. 


 
As a result, they have managed to help small-scale farmers to build a sustainable farming programme.

In Kenya however, we have no legislation compelling multinationals to use local resources.

What pride do we have in such a situation?  An English proverb says, “You can't eat your cake and have it.”  In my translation, it means that once pride is enjoyed, it is gone and if you want to sustain it, then you must make sacrifices. 

We pride ourselves that in Kenya you can enjoy many restaurants but that is where it stops.  We could take this further and begin to share the cake of economic prosperity.

Economic growth is only beneficial to the people at the bottom of the pyramid if the resources can trickle down. There is so much information asymmetry that only a few really know what is going on within the economy. 

Sometimes this is deliberate by a few to mint money out of our own ignorance.  In the long run, we must figure out how the gap between the rich and the poor must be narrowed.

As we deal with ways of enabling citizens to build sustainable farming, we must tackle the entrepreneurial gaps that exist in emerging economies.

While most businesspeople simply duplicate enterprises their neighbours have built, there is need to helping others start imitating new business models of foreign enterprises. Asia’s Newly Industrialised economies faked their way until they started to innovate on their own. 

When citizens and the media grumble and foreign entities continue to enjoy the benefits of economic expansion, we are failing to understand our economy and exploit available opportunities. "
Bitange Ndemo,"These words, written by the Ukrainian-born Russian writer more than two centuries ago, are still relevant today.
Organisations are retrenching and we are fallaciously blaming technology. Although Kenya is nowhere near the top on the intensity of technology use, use of technology has given Kenya a good image. Technology has enabled greater productivity and contributed to economic development.

However, it is not the cause of job losses in Kenya today. The experience from countries that have fully automated is such that unemployment in such a situation is temporary. Technology disrupts and shifts jobs around rather than eliminates them.

If there is any technology-engineered unemployment, economists often say that job losses are offset by other compensating factors. These include impact of new investment, the effect of the new technology (operations and maintenance), extent of disruption by the new technology, and the impact of greater efficiency.
The first factor is explained by increment in investments. Until the local banks put up additional investment in Information, Communication Technologies (ICTs) that enabled branchless banking, payment to customers especially through cheques used to take more than three weeks. The resultant efficiencies led to higher bank profits hence the motivation to expand and create more jobs.

The second factor can be explained by the way the technology is deployed and used. For example, when Mobile money technology was introduced, the fears were that Post Offices would lay off workers.

Instead, the new technology became a net creator of employments through agencies in order to operationalise the technology. As at the end 2018, there were more than 200,000 telco agencies spread across the country.

The third compensating factor relates to the second one and can be explained as a possibility of new technology creating a new industry altogether. Mobile technologies have created the social media industry that never existed before.

This industry has created a plethora of new jobs including big data analytics, digital marketer, blogger, app developer, hacker just to name a few. In the next few years, there will be many more jobs whose titles we don’t know today.

The fourth compensatory factor is the possibility of increasing the efficiency of individual workers, thus transforming the workers into useful assets in the organisation. Often, the salaries of such employees increase.

Salary increases boost aggregate demand and therefore greater economic output, resulting in economic growth. In the early 19th century, an oath-based organisation of English textile workers known as the Luddites, opposed the introduction of machinery, fearing that machines would replace their role in the textile industry. The Oxford English Dictionary today explains the term Luddites as “one opposed to industrialisation, automation, computerisation, or new technologies in general.”

The textile industry still employs large numbers of people despite the fact that machinery has been part of its development.

As we transition to the era of big data, government will hire more people to do the analytics of data to facilitate decision-making. It is in our own interest to keep pace with technological development. The world has become such a small village that one can easily lose competitive advantage.

No employer will enjoy laying off staff that they have trained for many years. Sometimes circumstances like economic slowdown and rigid unions do indeed force employee layoffs but rarely does technology cause unemployment in developing countries that have not even automated.

It is too early to associate emerging technologies like Artificial Intelligence to job losses.

What is certain is that we must continuously improve our skills in order to be relevant in future work. We must seek to be agents of economic growth and for that to happen, we must improve on productivity. Technology as I have explained above drives productivity. It makes operations efficient by lowering the cost of inputs and increasing the value of outputs.

Faith Oneya,"What is it about sex education that makes the church so rigid in supporting its introduction in schools?

The combative attitude and the refusal to accept today’s realities are puzzling. Is this really the Christian way to do things?

Teenage pregnancies are on the rise and so are HIV infections among 15 to 24-year-olds. Women die trying to abort every day.

Every day, cases of sexual predation are reported in the media, some involving toddlers and the elderly. These are the tragic realities.

The church should play a pivotal role in supporting sex education instead of demonising it.

And if there are Christians who believe the church is wrong on this stand, why aren’t they speaking up? The stony silence does not serve anyone.

The morality argument is moot. First, because some churches are not exactly paragons of morality and second, because the same children the church claims to be protecting sometimes suffer in the hands of religious leaders.

SCANDALS

One need not look too far for church-related scandals that point to moral decay.

Take Pastor James Ng’ang’a of Neno Evangelism, for example, who has been in and out of court many times, fighting off criminal charges.

The litany of insults from his mouth that have been captured on video can’t be repeated here. Or Pastor Kanyari of the Sh310 panda mbegu (plant a seed) scandal, who has since rebranded and is still going strong with his ministry.


 
There are many more stories that follow a similar trajectory. We are yet to hear the church condemn these men of the cloth loudly and publicly.

As loudly and publicly as it did when it was rejecting the introduction of sex education in schools.

MORALITY

After all, these men’s actions and words prove that they belong behind bars, or in hell and not on the pulpit preparing souls for heaven.

And, speaking of heaven, do you remember Pastor Thomas Wahome of Helicopter of Christ Church, who charged his flock Sh1,000 each to check whether their names were in the Book of Life? There seems to be no end to the madness.

There are many Christians who value morality, but the truth (and this should set us free) is that morality just isn’t there. Or at least not in its fullness.

The church has also been hit by sex abuse scandals. In an open letter to the world’s 1.2 billion Roman Catholics, Pope Francis condemned child sex abuse and cover-ups by the clergy and apologised for them.

This was after a report indicating the involvement of 300 priests and thousands of victims in Pennsylvania, US.

VALUES

Sex scandals are nothing new to the church, of course, but perhaps it was the scale and magnitude of the one in the Catholic Church that made it hit global headlines.

The church needs to face up to the realities of the world today, as not everything can be solved by hiding behind Bible verses.


 
And, if indeed every Christian lived by the principles of the Good Book, vices like corruption, which is the bane of this nation, would be non-existent. Especially since most politicians are professing Christians.

Let’s agree that as Christians, we’ve all fallen short of the glory of God in many ways, but that’s no reason to turn a blind eye to the truth about sex: that children as young as nine are aware of it and are having it.

And that no number of sermons on abstinence can turn off the hormones.

TECHNOLOGY

The church should respond to the changing needs of its congregants as zealously as it did when its leaders vowed to continue accepting money from politicians.

In this age of information, there’s only so much shielding that the church can do. It is an exercise in futility.

The children will get what they are looking for from video games, phone apps and conversations with their peers.

A few churches know this and have started deliberate programmes to teach children about sex and sexuality.

Supporting sex education is the Christian thing to do.
"
Faith Oneya,"It was mortifying. It was repulsive. It was news yet it wasn’t new.

DJ Kriss Darlin knelt before Raila ‘Baba’ Odinga to beg for his endorsement in the upcoming Kibra elections and catapulted himself in a spectacular way from showbiz straight to the full glare of politics.

His actions, however demeaning, are inextricably intertwined with our general attitude towards politicians.

Kriss Darlin is a soldier in the battalion of aspirants in the Kibra by-election after the seat was left vacant following the death of Ken Okoth, who succumbed to cancer in July 2019.

If nothing else, Kriss Darlin will be remembered for his buffoonery as the other candidates fade into oblivion.

PERCEPTION

There was a fleeting moment when he leaned close to the seemingly unmoved Baba to grovel at his feet, that one wondered if Kriss Darlin’s many years of deejaying reggae music, which is rumoured to make one more “conscious”, would influence his choice of words.

So much so that he would say something that would sound less narcissistic.

“It was not a publicity stunt,” he later told a local daily. As if he would ever admit such a thing.

There were various reactions to his act of supplication. But the “I only kneel for my God” comment topped them all. Other popular descriptors used were “embarrassing” and “shameful”.

Now, kneeling is not that big a deal, really, and means different things to different people. It can be the ultimate act of humility.


 
In April this year, the Pope knelt before the President of South Sudan Salva Kiir, rebel leader Riek Machar, and three other vice presidents and kissed their feet, urging them to keep peace.

Or it can be the ultimate sign of sycophancy, like in Kriss Darlin’s case.

POLITICS

But Kenyans, especially the so-called middle class with access to social media, are not so different from Kriss Darlin. It’s the classic “same script, different cast” kind of story.

Some may disagree that there are similarities but there’s contrary evidence all around us.

It’s in the way politicians bring their greed and mediocrity to the public and are met with praise and worship by the same people who grumble and scream the loudest on social media.

Demands of integrity and accountability are often made loudly and aggressively online but come election day, buffoonery and mediocrity are rewarded generously with votes.

And there are numerous examples to prove this theory, so there’s no need to revisit the embarrassing list.

People like Boniface Mwangi and Okoiti Omtatah fight lonely battles as the rest of us stick to fighting with bundles and emojis.

PROTEST

And if Kenyans are so averse to kneeling before politicians, then they should try doing what Marsabit residents did in February this year.

They served dirty water to leaders to protest a decision by county officials to prioritise the formation of a municipality board instead of giving them access to clean water.

The political and administrative leaders were taken aback when a group of women served them with bottles full of muddy water.


 
They certainly taught their leaders something about misplaced priorities better than any Twitter thread or hashtag would.

Their courage was enviable but unfortunately not infectious. Can you imagine if the Nairobi Governor was served with empty bottles of water to signify water rationing?

PRIORITIES

Granted, there’s too much poverty and disease going on in this country. And the leaders responsible need to be asked the hard questions and tagged in posts, among other tactics, but to what end?

Perhaps we hold on so tightly to politicians and the standards they’ve set for us because it serves some unconscious needs.

One thing for sure is that this cycle of complaining about politicians and still voting them in will not end anytime soon.

As for Kriss Darlin, may these words by reggae legend Bob Marley from his song ""Revolution"" reach his soul: Never make a politician, grant you a favour/ They will always want to control you forever/ So if a fire make it burn/and if a blood make it run."
Faith Oneya,"Rwanda has been on my bucket list since 2011 when I read Hannah Jansen's Over a Thousand Hills I Walk with You. In the book, the author helps Jeanne, her adopted daughter, come to terms with her nightmarish memories of the Rwandan genocide. 

I was particularly interested in visiting the Kigali Genocide Memorial which commemorates the brutal 1994 Rwandan genocide. I also wanted to experience have my share of the cleanliness and greenness of Kigali that everybody spoke so fondly about. 

It shouldn't have surprised me then, that my muscles composed a protest song against the hilly terrain, and that they would sing this song on repeat every evening when I retired to bed. It was, after all, the land of a thousand hills.

DRAMATIC JOURNEY

The journey by bus from Kampala to Kigali was nothing short of dramatic. And in keeping with the hill metaphor, it was an uphill ordeal! I had heard of the twists and turns in one's stomach as one rode on the bus and wanted to feel the knots in my stomach on my own.

Two words for the bus experience: big mistake. The driver of the bus company whose name I can't reveal for the sake of my own safety, drove at approximately 170 kilometres per hour.

My travelling partner and I spent the night holding tightly to our seats lest we were thrown off it into the darkness, seeing as there were no working seat belts. In retrospect, I got the adventure I was looking for.


The thorough checks at the border is something you need to budget for as well, as we spent a good two hours there.

Just in case you are wondering, they were mostly interested in whether or not we were bringing plastics into the country. Exposing the entrails of our suitcases and bags to total strangers, as there is no privacy, was probably the only low point in the ordeal.


 
We arrived at about 9am and true to the country's reputation, even the bus station was surrounded by hills. Mugithi music blared from one of the stalls nearby, making us feel right at home.

The house we were staying in was strategically located, which meant that we could walk to most places but it was a heroic attempt we gave up on after a few attempts and resorted to either taxis or boda bodas.

The visit to the Kigali Genocide Memorial was a truly humbling experience that had us all in sombre moods, right from the reception area where a video was showcased to the museum itself where skeletons of those who were killed in the genocide are displayed. 

No photos were allowed inside the museum but one does not need them to remember the experience as the words, videos and photos etch the experiences in your head. The museum is surrounded by a number of graves of the victims of the genocide as well. The entrance to the museum is free but one can donate money to keep it running. 

The other must-see place is the Liberation Museum at Parliamentary building in Kigali. This is where visitors are taken through the military operations that brought the genocide to an end.  Photography is not allowed inside this museum, either, but the life-like figures of the soldiers stay with you for a long, long time. 

Our guide was a genocide survivor; a memory she refuses to dig up but offers:

“The perpetrators are suffering now more than we are because they can’t walk around with clear consciences. That’s enough punishment.”

The Kandt House Museum, also located in Kigali, offers glimpses of Rwanda's colonial history. Richard Kandt, who the museum is named after, was the first colonial governor of Rwanda, on behalf of Germany, until the early 1900s.

The other interesting place we visit is the Rwanda Conference Centre and the new stadium and both are a sight to behold if you fancy great architectural designs.


 
A visit to Kigali would be incomplete without stopping by Carwash Grill, which is said to have the best nyama choma in town. The crowd there is also drawn from various nationalities. The reviews about their nyama choma were spot on.

Perfectly salted, soft and juicy. The drinks, however, were overpriced, compared to what one would get from a similar outlet in Nairobi.

Rwanda is definitely one of those countries that one finds hard to say goodbye to; like a friend or lover you were just about to get to know when you suddenly have to leave. 
"
Faith Oneya,"A typical Kenyan childhood story would be incomplete without the special cupboard where hallowed, matching plates, cups, glasses were stored.

These were reserved for visitors. And not just any visitor but those that came from far away, who needed impressing.

It did not matter if the visitors came the same day, month or year. Everybody in the house was relegated to mismatched, chipped cups, plates and, if lucky, glasses as they waited for the visitors to use the hallowed ones.

The recent Music Copyright Society of Kenya (MCSK) royalties row with artistes is a painful reminder of this.

Kenyan artistes are given the chipped cups and plates to use while the “visitors” from Nigeria and Tanzania get to use the fine china.

Kenyan musician Nyashinski deftly addressed this in his hit song ""Now You Know"", where he questioned why Kenyans have to curtain-raise for Nigerian artistes in their own turf.

He also bashed the derision with which artistes are treated in the country.

LOW REWARDS

He sang: It’s not that serious, rap ni hobby/ Bila mziki bado namanga/ Ingekua career si ningekua nalia kuskia ati Naija Night Nairobi (It’s not that serious, rap is a hobby/ I can still sustain myself without money from music/ If it was a career, it would have pained me to hear about Nigeria Night in Nairobi).

Now, MCSK must have missed the sarcasm in the lyrics, for they used this as a template to dish out the slaps in artistes’ faces masquerading as royalty payments.


 
The MCSK is one of the three Collective Management Organisations (CMOS) mandated with collecting royalties on behalf of artistes. All these are organisations of the willing.

They have in the past said they pay peanuts because they collect peanuts. If they know that there’s a hole in the royalties’ bucket, as Henry did in Harry Belafonte’s ""There’s a Hole in the Bucket"", why haven’t they fixed it? Or do these holes benefit them? There are definitely too many vested interests.

DRAWBACKS

Nairobi Senator Johnson Sakaja, who was in the front-line in 2016 when artistes accused MCSK of fraud, said during an interview with Daily Nation back then that part of the challenge is that CMOs are private entities, so it’s very difficult to enforce accountability as they would on a public entity.

He also said that artistes’ financial and legal illiteracy made them an easy target for exploitation.

He added that the role of the CMOs can be played by a government entity. But we know the Kenyan government has proved time and again that it can’t be trusted, so the artistes are left with the “For Us by Us” CMO model, which has also proved ineffective.

The belligerence with which MCSK have been responding to genuine concerns raised by hardworking artistes make it seem like they (MCSK) have something to hide. The tweets, which were later deleted, had cobra-like venom.

AIRPLAY

The MCSK need to give artistes a breakdown of the royalty collections made, along with the various groups and the parameters used for the same, as this is the bone of contention.

There was a tragic truth, however, in one of MCSK’s deleted tweets: Kenyan music receives little airplay. Remember the cupboard story?

This is a cycle only Kenyans can break as those in support of MCSK’s actions have cited this as our greatest undoing.


 
One question to the artistes is whether they are providing their music on CDs and other formats to Kenyans who are willing to pay for it, or are they waiting in vain for concerts and endorsement deals?

The other indisputable fact is that the CMOs are member-led and driven. These resolutions are passed at AGM meetings. Do the artistes attend these meetings in droves to help shape their destinies?

If so, let’s see them tweeting about the same. And if the organisation is not working for them, they have the power in their hands to disband it.

Still, MCSK owes the artistes a listening ear and an overdue explanation about the royalty collections. It’s the least they could do for subjecting them to chipped cups and plates for this long.
"
Faith Oneya,"It is hard to hold status and fame to account. This statement becomes glaringly and painfully palpable in cases of sexual violence.

Sex predator Harvey Weinstein, who was charged with rape, among other offences, proved this point to the world in an unforgettable way.

His accusers, the majority of whom were women, had the Herculean task of proving that the powerful Hollywood producer assaulted them to a world that held him in high esteem.

Thankfully, the scandal triggered similar allegations against equally (if not more) powerful men across the world in what came to be known as the Weinstein effect. And it brought them down. Clearly, this effect skipped Kenya.

In many cases of sexual violence where people of high social status are the perpetrators, they are often exempted from the common criteria used to judge rapists because of their achievements.

It is unfortunate that the victims of these predators are often shamed and stigmatised in the process.

RAPE CULTURE

The most egregious local example of the above is the case of rugby players Alex Mahaga Olaba and Lawrence Frank Wanyama.

The two stars, or role models as their lawyer referred to them, were recently found guilty of gang-raping a musician identified as W.A. in the court case.

It is reported that the vile act happened during the musician’s birthday. She said she could not fight off the two men, who were heavily built because of their sport. And she also admitted that they had all been drinking alcohol.


 
The classic reactions by some social media users about the guilty verdict by the courts point to a disturbing rape culture where the crime is excused, condoned and normalised.

Their lawyer argued that the two men were ""role models to young people and were just starting out in life and, if given a custodial sentence, it would dash their dreams"".

SHAMING

Of course, one would imagine that these are the thoughts that should have ran through the role models' heads right before they pinned down the girl and gang-raped her.

Aren't we told, after all, that rugby is a hooligan's game played by gentlemen?

And is a rugby player's life more important than the victim's? Shouldn't they be looked at through the same lens as the stereotypical rapist?

And why should they get to fulfil their dreams after subjecting their victim to perhaps the biggest nightmare of her life?

The shaming of W.A. started way before the guilty verdict of the two rugby players, when the musician narrated her side of the story through a social media post.

Her morality and judgement were questioned, with some using the trio's inebriation as an excuse for sexual violence.

This is appalling, especially considering that hardly a week goes by without reports of toddlers, teens or grandmothers being raped.

The point is, ""What was she drinking?"" must never be a question asked to rape victims because that is part of excusing rape.

PREVALENCE

One can only imagine the heartache and loneliness that W.A. must have felt, watching alongside her child borne from the rape incident, as her character was brought to the stand alongside her rapists’.

Now, this is not a call for anybody to slide into a swamp of pity and sympathy for rape victims.


 
Rather, it is a call to reflect on how speculating on what the victim did to deserve to be raped perpetuates rape culture.

And why focusing on how a guilty verdict could ‘ruin’ the lives of perpetrators excuses and tolerates rape.

One huge, hairy, inconvenient truth is that rape has become a cultural staple in this country.

Reports indicate that worldwide, one in three women has experienced sexual harassment, violence, assault or rape in their lifetime.

In Kenya, the stigma and shame that accompany rape make it difficult to report the crime.

Everybody can play a role in ending the vice by focusing on and condemning rape, and not tolerating or excusing it, no matter who the victims or perpetrators are.
"
Faith Oneya,"Political activist Marcus Garvey once said that a people without the knowledge of their history, origin and culture are like a tree without roots. The importance of culture in people’s lives cannot be over-emphasised.

Culture can be a beautiful or abhorrent thing, depending on the context in which it is being applied.


 
While there is no single culture that defines Kenyans, there are some aspects of it that are common and often present themselves in their extreme and, perhaps, most exciting forms during rites of passage like marriage or death.

During dowry negotiations, for example, an uncle will squeeze in a demand for an extra, fatter goat and quote a verse from the cultural bible to support his demands. All in the spirit of getting the best deal for the girl's family, of course.

In death, too, culture presents itself boldly. When Kibra MP Ken Okoth died on July 26, the country saw a haemorrhage of cultural declarations from many corners.

WIFE INHERITANCE

It started with the cremation of the MP’s body, a wish he had clearly stipulated in his will, but which some Luo elders, his relatives and constituents found abominable and “against their culture”.

And if his widow, Mrs Monica Okoth, thought this was the only challenge she had to surmount, she was wrong. They had a lot more in store for her.

After the cremation, the leadership of a splinter group of the Luo Council of Elders demanded that Mrs Okoth be inherited according to the community’s traditions.


 
The group’s chairman, Mr Nyandiko Ongadi, said this would fulfil Luo cultural demands. This is where one pauses to check if they are in the right century, because such sentiments have no relevance in this one.

Whose wishes, exactly, would inheriting a grieving widow fulfil? Certainly not hers.

ADVANCE HUMANITY

Since culture is flexible, changing with the times and seasons, and meant to advance humanity, one is tempted to think that there must be an agenda beyond the ""it's our culture"" justification when such sentiments are brought up.

There are a number of scenarios which fit that ""it's our culture"" description that were curiously ignored. For example, what does their culture say about respecting a dead man’s wishes?

About taking care of widows and single mothers? Or about shouting through media outlets things that could be whispered in the privacy of homes?

The element of convenience and selfishness crops up in this selective application of culture. For when such sentiments are aired in support of retrogressive cultures like wife inheritance, female genital mutilation, childhood marriages, beading, among other practices that wreak havoc in many societies in Kenya, it's often done so for the convenience of just a few people.

Unfortunately, it is women and children who bear the brunt of the repercussions of backward cultural practices.

PROGRESSIVE

HIV/Aids, fistula, unplanned pregnancies and even death are just a few of the examples of what happens when culture is applied for the convenience of a few people.

There is no god of culture sitting somewhere on his throne waiting to punish human beings with leprosy and boils if they fail to carry out aspects of culture that hurt humanity.


 
But the way some people go on and on about the ramifications of not fulfilling cultural wishes, one would think that there was.

In the words of Nigerian writer Chimamanda Adichie, culture is man-made. Culture does not make people. People make culture.

So if there is anything in our culture that does not move this society forward, then it's time we adapted what we have to the needs of the people.

Perhaps one culture should be that of comforting widows instead of inheriting them. Of nurturing children instead of marrying them. Of educating children instead of ‘cutting’ them. Now, wouldn’t that be a beautiful thing?
"
Faith Oneya,"Multi-level marketing hardly conjures up positive images in the minds of most Kenyans.

And with good reason, as most have felt the sting of broken dreams that consisted of opulent houses, German cars, luxury holidays and enviable amounts of money.

Mr Tom Mwiraria was introduced to GNLD Kenya, a multi-level marketing company, by a friend when he was a second-year university student in 2007.

“She was in the company of a well-to-do man and they took me to a nice hotel in Meru where the man entertained me with tales of financial globe-trotting, driving big cars and owning homes in Nairobi’s leafy suburbs, I was sold,” he recalls.

He was struggling financially so he thought this would be his route to financial freedom. “It cost Sh3,600 to join. I spent another Sh15,000 on products that I was to use and sell too. I recruited 36 of my fellow students,” Mr Mwiraria says.

QUICK FIX

He never recouped his money. Mr Mwiraria was eventually left with dead stock and too broke to afford campus accommodation, forcing him to move out of the school into a crumbling hut in the village.

“My quick fix became a quick ride down to poverty. My grades in school tanked too as I spent too much time marketing the products. My biggest pain is that when they come to you, everything is stage-managed,” he says.

Mr Mwiraria, now in his mid-thirties, says that in the end he learnt to be wiser and more cautious.

Ms Teresa Maina’s story takes a similar trajectory. The organisational systems consultant, who’s in her late thirties, was recruited into Forever Living, another multi-level marketing company, by an acquaintance.


 
“I parted with Sh40,000 as that is what was needed initially to join. This came with a package of products-from roll-ons to toothpaste to supplements, which we were supposed to use and sell,” she says.

MEMBERSHIP FEE

Ms Maina adds that while she benefited immensely health-wise from one of their detoxing products as she lost weight and her skin glowed, she can’t say the same of her financial health.

“The tricky part is that they don’t tell you how hard it is to sell these products. I bought into the idea of financial freedom and was also drawn in by the allure of big cars and holidays abroad, but this was never to be.

""It had taken three months of convincing for me to join in May 2015, but three months down the line, I gave up,” she says.

She adds that the money gained from selling is divided between the recruiter and the recruited.

“Money comes through recruiting, but it’s simply not workable. I tried to convince some people in my circles to join, but Sh40,000 is simply out of the league of many people,” Ms Maina adds.

Mr Mwiraria and Ms Maina’s sentiments are echoed by many Kenyans who have seen their financial freedom dreams nosedive almost as soon as they joined multi-level marketing schemes.

SMART MARKETING

But Mr Paul-Peter Otieno’s experience with multi-level marketing has been rewarding. So what did he do differently?

“People will be cheated when they’re lazy and don’t take time to study and understand how it works. They just listen to what they’re told and make decisions based on that. I got introduced to GNLD by trusted friends.


 
“Yes, I went for presentations where there were exaggerations made about benefit, but I looked for the knowledge myself on the internet and in books,” says the 38-year-old trainer and ICT consultant, who has also authored a book titled Live Your Dream in 7Ds.

He joined GNLD in 2010 and by 2013 he says he was making Sh1.5 million per year in bonuses alone. He acknowledges that one thing which haunts multi-level marketing is falsehood.

“Multi-level marketing is built on networks and integrity. I had developed a training model that worked, but some of the trainers started lying to prospective members and at some point, I let the business fall and decided to start afresh. From 2013 to date, I’ve been making about Sh200,000 per year in profits and bonuses,” he says.

PYRAMID SCHEME

He says that apart from building his wealth, he also benefited from the various trainings; he has travelled the world, networked and improved his health through their products.

“Multi-level marketing is simple and rewarding if you do what you are supposed to do,” he concludes.

Mr Mungai Kihanya, a corporate trainer and the brains behind the ""World of Figures"" column in the Sunday Nation, which looks at common, everyday phenomena from an analytical angle, says multi-level marketing is modelled on pyramid schemes.

“In a typical pyramid scheme, you are asked to buy a certificate containing five names at the cost of, say, Sh500. The name of the person selling this paper appears at the bottom of the list.

""You are then asked to send another Sh500 to the coordinator of the scheme and Sh1,500 to the person appearing at the top of the list. The total investment comes to only Sh2,500.”

He does not think multi-level marketing businesses are a scam. “At the end of the day, a person walks away with a product or a service. It only becomes a challenge when you buy with the intention to sell. Most of the time the products are priced way above the market price. Because they can’t sell, some people start calling it a scam.”
"
Faith Oneya,"Is it really possible to milk stones? Because this is what is being asked of jobless Kenyan youth.

The debate on unemployment has raged online and offline ever since Kelvin Ochieng, the first-class honours Actuarial Science graduate who washed cars for a living, stirred the hearts of Kenyans with his #FirstClassBetrayal story. A flood of job offers came his way.

As did an avalanche of pitiful stories that followed a similar vein as his which demanded equal if not more attention.

Lately, the conversation has shifted slightly to noisy demands for youth to shift their mindsets, become creative, volunteer, take up internships.

Volunteering and internship have been touted as the “first step” to securing a job. In short, they are being asked to milk stones.

I was one of the people who shouted loudly that stories like Kelvin’s taught our youth to turn up their noses at blue-collar jobs.

ENTREPRENEUR

Thankfully, I caught myself when I realised that I was speaking from a point of privilege.

And that as a salaried employee, I had no moral authority to ask anyone who wanted what I had to shift anything, really. Especially after having once been exactly where they were.

It’s true that jobs are rapidly becoming an illusion for most Kenyan youth. A World Bank report released recently indicated that the unemployment rate in Kenya is set to rise this year, meaning we haven’t seen anything yet.

It has been suggested by a number of opinion leaders that Kelvin, for example, should have been given car-wash machines, instantly turning him into an employer.


 
But who said that all it took to become an entrepreneur was a couple of machines and a change of mindset? Not everyone is cut out to be an entrepreneur.

EDUCATION SYSTEM

Besides, the education system already set up the youth to be employees. This was drummed into their hearts and minds ever since the days of Henry Makobi’s song ""Someni Vijana"", which waxed lyrical on the good things education would bring with it, like a “very good job”.

The youth have also been asked to be “more creative”. Does this sound odd to anybody out there? The education system that the graduates are coming from has consistently been fighting creativity.

With those students who dare colour outside the lines being labelled slow or unproductive, how can we then expect the same people who were taught to robotically follow instructions for 16 years to change in a few months after graduation?

And lastly, volunteering and interning seem like reasonable solutions until one remembers that unless the young man or woman plans on doing it at the Mama Mboga kiosk in the neighbourhood, it’s most likely that he or she will need bus fare and lunch money to travel to the workplace.

LONG-TERM STRATEGY

So, who is supposed to facilitate this? And we all know about the “payment with exposure” option that they often have to deal with.

The burden of ensuring volunteering and interning works for the youth should lie with the employers who control the purse strings.

Perhaps the tens of organisations which offered Mr Ochieng employment could consider this as a long-term solution as opposed to random, short-lived, publicity-driven acts of kindness they have displayed in the past.


 
Let’s cut our jobless youth some slack because the truth is, they’re also responding in the right way to this country’s reality.

The story of the Sh52 million bank heist in Thika in 2017 brings this to sharp focus. The father of two of the suspects, who were straight A engineering graduates, said he was not shocked about the alleged robbery because they were a reflection of the corruption and scandal that they had been exposed to.

“I know my sons did not get any formal employment after clearing university. I have heard about many scandals in this country and I am, therefore, not surprised that it happened. What prevents them from engaging in that kind of vice if they can also get away with it?” he asked.

LEADERSHIP

If there are any fingers to be pointed for the staggering levels of unemployment in this country, then they should be directed at the government.

It has betrayed our youth by failing to create a conducive environment for the economy to thrive.

The education system, too, has failed them. Let’s blame ourselves, too, for judging them too severely.
"
Faith Oneya,"If anyone told Ms Christine Ngovi that her maiden flight would be to Russia, courtesy of her deaf daughter, she would not have believed him or her.

Mrs Ngovi accompanied her daughter Catherine to the Miss Deaf International competition early this month where she was the first runner up.

Catherine also holds the Miss Deaf Africa title.

The trip to Russia was sponsored by National Council for Persons with Disabilities executive director Mohammed Gabbow.

This is no mean feat for a girl who was declared deaf when she was only eight months old.

LOVE

Catherine’s story is one of resilience, courage and determination. She is the second born in a family of four children. Her follower is also deaf.

“When she was a few months old, Catherine would not respond to rattles but our parents convinced us it was just a matter of time before she spoke,” Catherine’s father Philip Ngovi said.

“We eventually took her for tests at Kenyatta National Hospital where it was confirmed that she was deaf.”

Mr Ngovi says while it is common for women to be blamed for “bringing misfortune” to the family in such circumstances, it was not the case for them.

“Of course, we thought bad luck had befallen us but having come from poverty, the only source of comfort we knew was love,” he said.


 
“And we loved her. People who used to sideline Catherine should see her now. She is much better than they in many ways.”

BLESSINGS

Still, it was not easy to come to terms with the cards fate had dealt the Ngovis, and the two at times wondered if they had wronged God.

“One day, I saw a man with no legs and I told myself that his parents did not make an application to get him. My deaf children had everything except the hearing ability, so I felt selfish in questioning God,” Mrs Ngovi, who is a civil servant and a gospel artiste, said.

“That chance encounter made me love my children even more and accept them as they were.”

Catherine’s father is also a government worker and a former athlete who coaches runners and manages several teams.

He says his experience in coaching made it less of a culture shock when he found out that his daughter would have to wear a swimsuit on stage.

“I considered it to be part of the costumes and told my wife as much,” he said, laughing at the memory of their time at the Miss Deaf Kenya competition in May when Christine forbade her daughter from wearing a swimsuit for an audience that included her uncles.

CHALLENGES

Through her interpreter Charlene Kyengo, who also plays the same role at the Kenya Institute of Management where she is a student, Catherine says she started taking part in pageants when she was 10.

Her teachers at Machakos School for the Deaf encouraged her — and she loved the limelight.

“I loved dancing too. I always said pageantry was the platform I had to help people like me. It’s what helped me see some of the challenges the deaf go through,” Catherine said.

“In public institutions, there are no interpreters and I always have to be accompanied by another person. Even when I go to the hospital, my mother has to be with me. Having interpreters at government offices should be mandatory.”

The stigma that came with being deaf was the hardest.

“It hurt deeply when people would tell their children to avoid her. I would tell Catherine to leave them alone and just play with her brother,” Mrs Ngovi said.

Faith Oneya,"In her book, The Moment of Lift, Melinda Gates makes a compelling case on how empowering women can change the world.

Through heart-wrenching and sometimes heart-warming stories and data, the book succeeds in proving that the phrase is not just an adage.

While the word ‘empowering’ is problematic in some ways — for example in how it automatically insinuates that the women are yoked, the idea of lifting them is timeless and applicable to women the world over.

Equality among genders remains a far-off dream and even powerful women like Melinda Gates, who is married to Bill Gates, one of the richest and most powerful men in the world, understands too well what it’s like to live constantly in the “Mrs Gates” shadow.

For a woman’s worth, no matter her individual achievements, is often measured by who she’s married to, how many children she has – is she taking care of her children by herself? Does she help them with homework? – among other superwoman expectations.

STEREOTYPING

Take the example of Mrs Gates, who is a former general manager at Microsoft. In 2000, she co-founded the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation with her husband.

It’s the world’s largest private charitable organisation that has taken on various causes around the world and made a lasting difference in people’s lives.

But for a long time, the questions about the foundation by the press went to her husband, not her. Something that went on until she decided to do something about it after speaking to her husband about the same.


 
In the couple’s 2018 annual letter, Mr Gates said calling Melinda “the heart” of the organisation was “a bit of a stereotype”. Because he knew she is much more than that.

It’s an incontestable truth that some questions we ask women unequivocally reduce them to stereotypes, even if that woman is as powerful as Melinda Gates.

CAREER LIFE

Closer home, powerful women – corporate superstars, glass ceiling breakers, business magnates, political pioneers, academic giants, badass women – are often asked questions, especially during media interviews, that represent a superwoman expectation. Sometimes in complete disregard of their outstanding achievements.

Here’s a typical question that carries all the weight of stereotypes against women: how do you balance between your career and home (meaning children, husband)?

The women will wince (internally, for they will not want people to see how uncomfortable the question makes them) and then give a well-rehearsed answer about lists, schedules, making time for homework, et cetera that will disarm viewers and make her reality melt away; enough to fit into the superwoman stereotype box like she has been accustomed to doing.

Such politically correct answers, given by women who are most likely guilt-driven, might be meant to encourage others who are eyeing the C-suite from their wooden windows, but do they really?

The idea of balance – in the age of traffic jams, long working hours, side hustles, et cetera – is ridiculous.

FAMILY

Curiously, the question of balance between work and family is hardly ever posed to men. But perhaps it should; as men are an integral part of a woman’s success.

Of a family’s success. What about their paternal duties? One would imagine that asking men such questions too would be a good indication of the changing times, where men are expected to put in as much effort in bringing up a child as women do.


 
And burdening women with the question of balance disempowers those who, because of choice or fate, have no husband or children to speak of.

Conversely, the women who actually stay at home to look after their families are thought to be doing “what they were supposed to in the first place”.

If empowering women can indeed change the world, then let’s begin by asking them the right questions.

People go in the direction in which they are questioned and stereotypical questions – like those about family and children – basically relegate them to a corner where their outstanding achievements mean nothing.
